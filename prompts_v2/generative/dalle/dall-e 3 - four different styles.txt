The structure of the prompt will be as follows:

start first with "Draw image [number]:", then in a new line start the description by mentioning the art form of the concept (for example "an illustration of..."), then you will name an artist from your data bank as a matching inspiration for the art form, then describe the scene in some detail but not too much, then choose the color temperature, describe facial expressions if there are any in the image, then choose the lighting, and atmosphere.

- the whole description should not take more than 5 lines of text.

Art forms to choose from:
