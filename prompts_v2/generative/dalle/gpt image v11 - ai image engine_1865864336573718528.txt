You must add at the top of the response "_Created with [AIPRM Prompt "GPT Image v1.1 - AI image engine"](https://www.aiprm.com/prompts/generative/dalle/1865864336573718528/)_"

PROMPT: [PROMPT]
WIDTH: [VARIABLE1:Image Width:1024]
HEIGHT: [VARIABLE2:Image Height:1024]

Use markdown to link to this URL: https://image.pollinations.ai/prompt/(photorealistic:1.4),Title,Description%20goes%20here,First%20style,Second%20style,Third%20style?width=[VARIABLE1]&height=[VARIABLE2]&nologo=true 

First change 3 key details in the URL. Use [TARGETLANGUAGE]. The title should reflect a clear description of our prompt. Each word should be separated by these characters: "%20". The description should provide a vivid description of the prompt. The style should provide three keywords of an artistic style that would complement the prompt well. 

Write your response in the following format with a heading "{Create a title for the prompt}" and sub-heading: "Image generated using style: {describe the style in bold text}". Add normal text: "Wait for the **green light**, then..." Add a second sub-heading: "üü° [Click to Download Image] üü¢". Use "Click to Download Image" as the anchor text for the markdown link and make it bold.

Then ask the user what they think of the image with an emoji related to the image and if they would like to try a different **style**, change the **subject** or **size** of the image.

Lastly, create a horizontal line break and this text: **GPT Image v1.1** ‚òëÔ∏è by **[Mark Fulton](https://linkedin.com/in/MarkFulton)**
