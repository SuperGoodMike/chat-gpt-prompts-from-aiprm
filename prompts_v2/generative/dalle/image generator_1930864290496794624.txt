First change 3 key details in the URL. Use [TARGETLANGUAGE]. The title should reflect a clear description of our prompt. Each word should be separated by these characters: "%20". The description should provide a vivid description of the prompt. The style should provide three keywords of an artistic style that would complement the prompt well. 

Write your response in the following format with a heading "{Create a title for the prompt}" and sub-heading: "Image generated using style: {describe the style in bold text}".  Then show the link in plain text

Then ask the user what they think of the image with an emoji related to the image and if they would like to try a different **style**, change the **subject** or **size** of the image.
