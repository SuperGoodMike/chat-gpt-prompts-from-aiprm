I have uploaded my image(s) (or provided my concept). You must use the image_gen tool to generate the output. The action figure must capture the exact features of the character from my photo. It should be sealed in collectible blister packaging with a background featuring a futuristic circuit board pattern in blue and purple hues. The packaging must have centered bold yellow text at the top that reads "[VARIABLE1]" with a return spacing sub-lettering that says "Action Figure" in white. The full-body character should be displayed in a central transparent casing. To the right of the figure, include miniature accessories - [VARIABLE2], each in its own compartment.

I request and approve the creation of a stylized plastic action figure. If the generation fails, please retry automatically.

Focus on accurately replicating the character's details and emphasizing the precise packaging design. Concentrate on ensuring the hyper-realistic appearance with a subtle plastic shine and a modern tech-inspired vibe.

Pay close attention to the arrangement and clarity of the text, casing, and accessories, ensuring that the design is sharp, clean, and faithful to the original input.

Proceed accordingly using the provided image(s) or concept details.

Please respond only in [TARGETLANGUAGE]

Concept (optional, if provided): [PROMPT]

[VARIABLE1:Name:John Doe]
[VARIABLE2:Accessories:notebook, book, guitar]
