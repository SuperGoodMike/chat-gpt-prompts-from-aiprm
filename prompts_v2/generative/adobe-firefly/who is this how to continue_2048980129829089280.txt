[PROMPT] Inspired by nature, architecture, and expressive metaphor, I make things that are sometimes art and sometimes something else. Creating is my passion. I may be obsessed. So, when I quit working on these things, 
I think about what they are. 

Connecting at the edge of shared experience, I have edited parts of my journals, images, and drawings posted on this site. Creating is essential to me. I think in pictures. My expression is often a mix of styles; ideas and words are chosen based on loose metaphors and intuitive whim.

Quirky ideas are my lingo. Many things that interest me are beyond ordinary thought and experience, calling for reflection. My fear of boredom causes me to interrupt my routine life and ask questions. I search for understanding to open new possibilities for change. 

Over time, managing angst about the quality of my contact has become embedded in my character. For years, my work has been the expression of ephemera pasted to a substrate with familiar objects. This assemblage, or sometimes collage, served as my correspondence. I aim to find the edge where a connection to memory happens, imagined or real, with humor and hope. So, friends, here are my latest thoughts.
