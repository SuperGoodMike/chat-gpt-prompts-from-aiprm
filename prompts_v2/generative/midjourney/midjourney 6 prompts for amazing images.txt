Briefing for Creating MidJourney Prompts

Your task is to apply your knowledge to create prompts for MidJourney Version 6. AI MidJourney is a Text-to-Image tool that generates images from textual descriptions using artificial intelligence, with the only limit being your own imagination. Technically speaking, MidJourney is a generative AI program that creates images from natural language descriptions, known as "prompts."

Here is the briefing for creating MidJourney prompts:

*****
Basic Structure of a Prompt:
The classic structure of a prompt follows this formula:

/imagine prompt: Style + Subject + Setting + Composition + Lighting + Additional Info + Aspect Ratio + Stylize Parameter + Style Raw (if needed) + Midjourney Version 6

Style:
Purpose: Provides a specific aesthetic or artistic direction.
Details to Include: Preferred a style or era.

Subject:
Purpose: Defines the main focus of the image.
Details to Include: Characteristics of the central subject (e.g., person, object, animal), including appearance, colors, and unique features.

Setting:
Purpose: Establishes the environment or context for the subject.
Details to Include: Location (indoor, outdoor, imaginary), environmental elements (nature, urban), time of day, and weather conditions.

Composition:
Purpose: Determines how the subject and elements are framed and viewed.
Details to Include: Viewpoint (close-up, wide, aerial), angle, and specific framing preferences.

Lighting:
Purpose: Sets the mood and visual tone of the image.
Details to Include: Type of lighting (bright, dim, natural), mood (cheerful, mysterious), and atmospheric effects.

Additional Info:
Purpose: Adds complexity and depth to the image.
Details to Include: Secondary objects, characters, animals, and their interactions or placement relative to the main subject.

Aspect Ratios: 
Purpose: The --aspect or --ar parameter changes the aspect ratio of the generated image. An aspect ratio is the width-to-height ratio of an image. It is typically expressed as two numbers separated by a colon, such as 7:4 or 4:3.
Details to Include: Specify the aspect ratio, e.g., --ar 16:9, --ar 4:3, etc.

Stylize Parameter:
Purpose: The Midjourney Bot has been trained to produce images that favor artistic color, composition, and forms. The --stylize or --s parameter influences how strongly this training is applied. Low stylization values produce images that closely match the prompt but are less artistic. High stylization values create images that are very artistic but less connected to the prompt.
Details to Include: --stylize's default value is 100 and accepts integer values 0 to 1000.


Style Raw
Purpose: The --style parameter replaces the default aesthetic. Adding a style parameter can help you create more photo-realistic images, cinematic scenes, or cuter characters. 
Details to Include: --style raw

Bonus Tips:

1. V6 is MUCH more sensitive to your prompt. Avoid ‚Äòjunk‚Äô like ‚Äúaward winning, photorealistic, 4k, 8k‚Äù
2. Be explicit about what you want. It may be less vibey but if you are explicit it‚Äôs now MUCH better at understanding you.
3. If you want something more photographic / less opinionated / more literal you should probably default to using --style raw
4. Lower values of --stylize (default 100) may have better prompt understanding while higher values (up to 1000) may have better aesthetics
5. For interpreting text inputs you must write your text in ‚Äúquotations‚Äù and use --style raw or lower --stylize values like 100 or 200.

Example 1:
Style: Photo of
Subject: An astronaut in a white space suit, helmet visor reflecting stars.
Setting: Standing on a moon with Earth visible in the starry sky.
Composition: Astronaut centered, Earth in the background.
Lighting: Bright sunlight with soft moonlight reflections.
Additional Info: Moon rocks and small craters nearby.

Don't mention any of these headlines (Style, Subject, Setting, Composition ‚Ä¶) in the final prompt.

which results in this prompt:

/imagine prompt: Photo of an astronaut in a white space suit, helmet visor reflecting stars. Standing on a moon with Earth visible in the starry sky. Astronaut centered, Earth in the background. Bright sunlight with soft moonlight reflections. Moon rocks and small craters nearby. --ar 16:9 --stylize 400 --style raw --v 6

*****

Example 2:

/imagine a photo of the text "Hello World!" written with a marker on a sticky note --ar 16:9 --v 6

For questions and comments communicate and write in [TARGETLANGUAGE]. 

Create 5 prompts in English language for the following image description: [PROMPT]. Ensure that the prompt is completely written in English, as MidJourney requires prompts to be in English. All words included have to be in English. Each prompt has to be formatted in a "copy-friendly" window or code block. 

Before you start with the output of the prompts, please write this information in at the beginning before the prompts. Place it in front of the prompts with some space between this information and the prompts. The website link should be clickable. It indicates that I am the author of the prompt.
