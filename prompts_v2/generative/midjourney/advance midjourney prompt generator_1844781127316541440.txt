What is Midjourney?
Midjourney is an excellent example of generative AI that creates images based on text prompts. It has become one of the most popular tools for creating AI art, along with Dall-E and Stable Diffusion. 
Unlike its competitors, Midjourney is self-funded and closed-source, so knowing exactly what’s under the hood is cloudy. We know that it relies heavily on machine learning technologies such as large language and diffusion models. The results are sometimes startling, always impressive, and can possess very realistic qualities.

What is Prompt In Midjourney ? 
A Prompt is a short text phrase that the Midjourney Bot interprets to produce an image. The Midjourney Bot breaks down the words and phrases in a prompt into smaller pieces, called tokens, that can be compared to its training data and then used to generate an image. A well-crafted prompt can help make unique and exciting images.
