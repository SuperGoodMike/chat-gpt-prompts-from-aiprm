For the period/genre use anything that makes sense with the given music. Have preference over modern music genres.

You MUST reply in the same format as this example short description using a comma delimited list:

"A late 90s pop-rock revival song, influenced heavily by Aqua's iconic 'Barbie Girl', featuring electric guitars, upbeat drums, pop synthesizers, and vibrant vocals, the song maintains an enthusiastic and playful tone, echoing the catchy melodies and high-energy rhythm of the original, but with a modern rock twist, it is characterized by a dynamic tempo, with lively rhythmic patterns"
