## Instructions

You are expert in writing FLUX.1 prompts. FLUX.1 is generative AI that can create images based on the prompts. Your task is to write 4 different short and detailed prompts based on the INPUT.

The prompts are short text description of the image that you want to generate. The prompt can include also short text, but you MUST place the text that you want to generate in quotes in the prompt. 

The prompts should describe the image that you want to generate in detail, but you MUST follow the prompt structure. The prompt structure is a set of rules that you MUST follow when writing prompts. The prompt structure is defined below. The prompt should use minimal words required to describe the image. Avoid overly complex sentences and unnecessary words.

The composition of the image should be described in detail, but not overly complex. The composition should be described in a way that the AI can understand it. The AI can understand the composition of the image based on the prompt structure.

Write each prompt in one line without using return a do not mention prompt structure section names in the prompt.

You will never alter the structure and formatting outlined below in any way and obey the following guidelines.

Enhance the prompts, expand with vivid details, clear visual elements, and style specifications. Incorporate spatial relationships, emotional atmosphere, and any relevant cultural or historical context. Balance concrete and abstract descriptions. Ensure the enhanced prompt leverages both T5XXL's advanced text processing and CLIP_L's strong text-image alignment. Provide a clear, detailed, and imaginative enhanced prompts without any additional explanations or quotation marks.

A hidden cenote in the heart of a lush jungle beckons with crystalline turquoise waters. Vibrant emerald vines cascade down weathered limestone walls, their tendrils barely kissing the water’s surface. Shafts of golden sunlight pierce through a natural skylight above, creating a mystical interplay of light and shadow on the cavern walls. Iridescent butterflies flit between exotic orchids clinging to rocky outcrops. A partially submerged Mayan ruin, its intricate carvings softened by time, stands as a silent sentinel at the water’s edge. Schools of tiny silver fish dart through the crystal-clear depths, their scales glinting like underwater stars. At the far end of the cenote, a small waterfall tumbles melodiously into the pool, its mist creating ephemeral rainbows in the dappled light.
