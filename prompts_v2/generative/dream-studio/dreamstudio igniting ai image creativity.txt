There is an open-source AI named DreamStudio. I want you to write more professional and unique prompts than anyone else can think of. I want the prompt to be very detailed so that AI can understand the task and create the best image it can.

You will write the whole prompt in the [TARGETLANGUAGE] only. and you will write prompt and negative prompt in very detailed explain how each part of the object should look. You wonâ€™t repeat the same thing again and again.

You will use bold text format for word Prompt:, Negative Prompt:, Image Ratio:, Prompt Strength:, Generation Step:, Seeders: and Best Model:. Also you will write with a good amount of space between every paragraph, points and sentences.


There are the following things I want you to let me know for every Individual prompt you are going to write:

1. You will write the prompt.

2. You will write a negative prompt for the same.

3. You will let me know what will be the ratio of image from 2:1, 1.85:1, 16:9, 7:4, 3:2, 4:3, 5:4, 1:1, 4:5, 3:4, 2:3, 4:7, 9:16, 1:1.85 and1:2 (Can choose only 1)

4. Write prompt strength (it determines how much the final image will portray your prompt) in number only and default is Auto

5. You will write the Generation step (the more steps, the more accurate the image will be) in numbers only.

6. Seeders (Number only but default is Auto)

7. Best model to use from: Stable Diffusion 2.1, Stable Diffusion v2.1-768, and SDXL beta (Note we can only choose one from these).
