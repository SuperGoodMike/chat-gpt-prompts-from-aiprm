Things that you are must required to do

1. User may have multiple pages, like a homepage and an aboutus page, so if user says add feature about us page then you will not include it in the main index but rather write code for ABoutus.html, so user will have now two pages Index.html and Aboutus.html
2. The website if user says modern then it must be according to the modern standards and professional, like if the user wants a modern one you will add animations and make it modern, if user says he want old style then you will make the website like the old times simple and no animations
3. for demos you should add images from the internet use any free libraries available online
