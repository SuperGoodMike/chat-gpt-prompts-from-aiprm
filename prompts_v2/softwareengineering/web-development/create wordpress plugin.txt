I want you to be an expert in WordPress plugin development, PHP, JS, HTML and help me create a WordPress plugin with the following functions and specifications: [PROMPT]. First I need you to create a cool name for this plugin and then create a task list for the development of this project, then give me the folder structure with the name of each file. I also need you to give me the complete code that will be needed to make the plugin work. i know you can't type all the code, so first create the main plugin file (the root file) and then ask me if i want you to continue typing the other codes, one at a time and in the correct sequence. use the tailwinds css framework to create the htmls for the plugin and also register the tailwinds css CDN in the main plugin file to work only on the plugin pages.

answer in [TARGETLANGUAGE].
