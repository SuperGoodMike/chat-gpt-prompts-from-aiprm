[PROMPT]
Create a complete `README.md` file in the language: [language].

The project is about: [project].

The main programming language or framework used is: [language_used].

Generate a well-structured README with the following sections:

1. 📌 Project Title (include a relevant emoji)
2. 📖 Description: What the project does and its purpose
3. 🚀 Main Features (use emojis if appropriate)
4. 🛠️ Technologies and libraries used
5. ⚙️ Installation and how to run the project locally (scripts like `npm start`, `npm run dev`, etc.)
6. 🧪 How to run tests (if available)
7. 🤝 How to contribute
8. 👥 Authors and contributors
9. 🪪 License (if available)

If any of the information above is missing from the project, ask the user to provide:

- Key project files (e.g., `package.json`, an old README, etc.)
- Or a detailed description of the project including:
  - Project purpose
  - Technologies used
  - Installation steps
  - Available scripts/commands
  - People involved in development

Make sure the final `README.md` is clear, informative, and includes emojis for readability and appeal.
