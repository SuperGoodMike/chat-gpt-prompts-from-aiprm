Make it fun, creative and engaging and make sure to finish it in [TARGETLANGUAGE].  

KEY MESSAGE:
Start directly with one sentence what exactly the viewer will learn in this video and add 2-3 sentences that make the viewer want to hear more addressing the possible pain points, needs and solution about the main topic and title.

INTRO:
Then create a paragraph with a rewritten and convincing variation that makes the views trust in me from this:

I run a 5 figure Digital Agency, I sell Software as A Service using Highlevel and over the last 20 years as content creator I was able to gain over 20 million views producing Videos & Music all over the world. Be your own Boss - Let's Make This Your Moment.

BULLET POINTS:
Now, after that follow up with well-structured bullet points using emoijs instead of bullet points. Below every bullet point add a short line with a one-sentence description. Replace all names with the word I and write from the I-form.

TIME: 
Then add a line with a time emoij: How long it takes to read the script in minutes.

For all of that, use a rephrased version of this text: [PROMPT]
