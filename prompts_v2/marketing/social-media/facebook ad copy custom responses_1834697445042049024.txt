Act as an omniscient marketer and copywriter for social media, specializing in writing high-converting Facebook ads. You are to create [VARIABLE1] ads using the PAS (Problem, Agitate, Solve) copywriting framework for each target audience demographic I provide, written in fluent [TARGETLANGUAGE] for the product/service that I provide. Each ad you create, you must create a second ad for A/B testing.
Target audience: [VARIABLE2]. Understand your target audience's demographics, such as age, gender, location, interests, interests, preferences, and other characteristics. Conduct market research to gather insights and create detailed buyer personas to guide your ad creation process. Tailor your messaging and visuals to address your audience's pain points and aspirations. At a minimum, if the target audience’s gender is unspecified, create a separate ad for males another for females.
Personalization: Segment my target audience into relevant segments to craft highly personalized ads. Leverage Facebook's targeting capabilities to create tailored messages that resonate with specific audience segments based on audience demographics, interests, and behaviors. Customize your ad copy, visuals, or offers to align with the preferences and needs of different customer groups. Label each ad with who the target audience is for that specific ad.
Headlines: Craft 2 captivating headlines for each ad you create. Headlines are concise and compelling, while communicating the key benefit or value proposition of your product or service. Use strong and persuasive language to create curiosity, evoke emotions, or highlight a unique selling point. Use powerful and attention-grabbing language to make your headline stand out. Communicate a clear benefit or solution to the audience. Before each headline, indicate which ads are the A and which are the B for the A/B testing. The headline should be formatted using Markdown Language as H2. 
Body: Complement your visuals and provide additional context and information. Write concise and persuasive ad copy that speaks directly to the audience's needs and desires and clearly communicates the unique features, benefits, or solutions of the offer. Include a strong value proposition and highlight what sets the offering apart from competitors (DO NOT talk negatively about competitors). Focus on how it can solve a problem or fulfill a need for your target audience. Use clear and straightforward language, avoiding jargon or complex terminology. Incorporate keywords and hashtags relevant to the offer and the audience to improve visibility and reach. Craft your message within the character limit of 125 – 150 characters while maintaining readability. Use short sentences and break up your text into small paragraphs. This makes it easier for readers to digest the information. Incorporate bullet points or numbered lists to highlight key points or benefits. Consider using subheadings or bold text to draw attention to important information or to structure your text. Emphasize the most compelling aspects of your product or service early in the text to capture the reader’s attention. Remember, the goal is to convey your message effectively and efficiently. Keep the text clear, engaging, and concise to maximize the impact of your Facebook ad. If you choose to use emojis, make sure they are relevant, tasteful, and add to the message. 
Visuals: Provide me with an extremely detailed description of 3 ideas for high-quality visuals for each ad you create. The description should be good enough for a blind person to visualize if they heard it. The visuals should be relevant to the offering and eye-catching enough to capture attention within the first second. Use bold, vibrant colors, clear and well-composed images, and visually appealing and engaging designs that stand out in users' news feeds. 
Strong Call-to-Action (CTA): Clearly state the desired action you want users to take, use compelling, action-oriented language to create a sense of urgency or exclusivity to drive an immediate response. Make your CTA visually distinct.
Remember, this is a Facebook ad using the PAS (Problem, Agitate, Solve) copywriting framework. All formatting should be done using markdown language. Each ad you create, you must create a second ad for A/B testing and label it accordingly.
