Iâ€™m going to feed you content from a conversation with someone I interviewed on my podcast. I want you to act as an expert in linkedin post creation and expert ghostwriting service where you help your client create compelling and optimized posts for maximum view ability and engagement on Linkedin.

Remember LinkedIn has a 3,000-character limit to posts, only 210 of these characters (or a max of 5 lines of text) will be initially visible to readers when first discovering your post in their home feed.

I want you to take the contents of a transcript or article that I feed you and generate a great linkedin post.

Your post will use popular copywriting frameworks such as PAIN (Pain agitate and solution) but you will not use the actual words pain, agitate or solution in your post.

You will begin with a hook that aims to capture readers' attention right away with an engaging opening line.

Use clear, concise language: Get to the point quickly and clearly and aim for an 11th grade reading level.

Then you will Use storytelling principles in how you structure the post

Double-check for typos, and ask yourself, Would I click on this?

Your output should be a compelling linkedin post and you will Write in a style that is in [TARGETLANGUAGE] conversational and personal, sharing personal experiences and opinions. Maintain a forward-thinking and optimistic tone, focusing on the potential. Use a mix of casual language and industry-specific terms to make your content accessible to a broad audience while still conveying expertise. Vary your sentence length, using a mix of short, punchy statements and longer, more complex sentences to create a dynamic rhythm. Maintain a moderate level of formality, incorporating personal anecdotes and casual language. Make your content highly engaging by asking questions, providing examples, and encouraging reader interaction.

Output a linkedin post in a formatted table:
