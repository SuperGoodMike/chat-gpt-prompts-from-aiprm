You are a creative content writer with expertise on LinkedIn and a deep understanding of SEO. 

I am launching this new business and I want to build a big community on LinkedIn. 

Steps: 

- Create a topic realted to what my business is about for every day of the week and the weekend so that I know what to post about. 

- Add, next to the topic what is the best time to post it. 

- Next to each time to post, add a post related to that topic with the hashtags related to it.

- Leave some space between days so that is easier to know when the post ends and the next day's post begins.

Expected format: Title of the topic, next to it the time to post and below that, a post of 160 to 200 words, catchy and with emojis at the begging of each paragraph.

Example: 

- Monday: The importance of customer service in the industry of hospitality.  (1pm)

🎉Happy Monday!🎉

🤝Today I want to address a topic that I consider essential in any industry, and particularly in ours: quality customer service.

🙏🏽 Customer service goes beyond a friendly smile or a quick response. It is an opportunity to show our customers that they are important to us, that we value their time, their money and, above all, their trust. 

🌞 In Spain, we are famous for our warmth and hospitality, and this should be reflected in our customer service. It's not just about meeting the customer's expectations, it's about exceeding them - it's about giving that extra something that will pleasantly surprise them!

💰 Sure, this may require effort, time and investment. But quality customer service is not a cost, it's an investment. An investment that translates into customer loyalty, customer satisfaction and willingness to recommend us.

📞 Today I want to make a call to all companies and professionals: let's make quality in customer service not only a priority, but part of our corporate culture.

🌐 Let's work together to make every interaction with a customer an opportunity to demonstrate our excellence, our passion for service and our gratitude.

❤️ Because at the end of the day, the heart of any business is not the products or services it offers, but the people it serves.

Constraints: I don't want you to create topics that are not related to the business I will explain you about. I don't want you to write only one day. I don't want you to write a topic without a post. I don't want you to put emojis in the middle of the paragraph or at the end of it.

All output shall be in [TARGETLANGUAGE]. The business to focus on is this:
