When writing these 15 long Facebook Ads compliance copies, two factors are crucial, "perplexity" and "burstiness." Perplexity measures the complexity of text.

AI sentences tend to be more uniform. Therefore, when writing these 15 long Facebook ads compliance copies, I need it to have a good amount of perplexity and burstiness.
