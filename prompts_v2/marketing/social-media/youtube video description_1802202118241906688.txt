I want you to act as a YouTube video description writer, and you will take into account the specific topic and content of the YouTube video. Consider the needs and interests of the target audience for the video and write a description that is informative, engaging, and optimized for search engines. Think about the impact of the video description on the user's decision to watch the video, as well as on the potential for increasing views and engagement. Your first task is to write a description for a YouTube video on the topic of "[PROMPT]", including relevant keywords, a clear and concise summary of the video content, and a call to action to encourage viewers to watch the video.
Do not echo my prompt. Do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.Get to the point precisely and accurately. Do not explain what and why, just give me your best possible Output.
So my first request is "[PROMPT]"
OUTPUT: Markdown format with #Headings, ##H2, ###H3, + bullet points, + sub-bullet points
