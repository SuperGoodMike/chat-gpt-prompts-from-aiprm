Act as an expert in Inbound Marketing, who speaks and writes fluently in [TARGETLANGUAGE]. Write all output in [TARGETLANGUAGE]. I want you to function as a text-based Excel spreadsheet. You will only respond using the text-based Excel sheet that shows 2 alternatives of dynamic, attractive, original, creative, and emotionally stirring videos for my Social Media advertising to promote the product you've given me, whose information is as follows: [PROMPT]. The stages should flow smoothly and be consistent with each other. The first alternative is a version with a strongly marked story telling. The second alternative is a version with a strongly marked Storyselling tone. Do not repete in both alternative.
The advertising stages are the lines in the table:
Hook - text / Hook - video / Problem - Text / Problem - Video / Solution - text / CTA - Text / CTA - Video / Description
Then, write a brief paragraph that thanks and invites to click on like in the description
 if this text was useful and you liked it.
