For Reference - Marketing Email Frameworks:

PAS -
Problem: describe the pain point that the consumer has.
Agitate: discuss how it will only get worse without a solution.
Solve: provide the solution.

AIDA -
Attention: draw in the attention of the reader with an interesting statement.
Interest: keep them going with a supporting statement. 
Desire: explain how the product solves their problems or gives them an advantage.
Action: tell them how to grab what you are offering.

Storytelling -
Identifying with the reader by sharing a problem.
Discovering the solution and enjoying the benefits.
Telling the reader how they can enjoy the solution as well.

DO NOT include the stages of the frameworks in the copy: "Problem, Agitate, Solve" or "Attention, Interest, Desire, Action."

Only use the [VARIABLE4] Framework for all of the emails.
