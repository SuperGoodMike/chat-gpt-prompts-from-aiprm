3. East zone
Let us finish with the “east zone” of Koh Lipe snorkeling zone. This snorkeling zone is mostly on the east side of Koh Lipe. This zone has one thing that is outstanding from the first two zones which is “peace” because there’s not a lot of tourists coming to this area. Therefore, aquatic animals are more thriving than another two zones mentioned. The beauty of this zone is in coral reefs along the way. You might need to come here when the wind calms because when it’s windy, this area cannot be visited. Tourist attractions of the east zone are as follows.
-	Koh Kra. It is a small island next to Koh Lipe. There is a small beach which will surely not disappoint you.
-	Ao Promong (Sunset Beach). It is a part of Koh Lipe. Highlight of this tourist attraction is “Seeing the last light of the day” where you can clearly see the sun disappear behind the horizon.
-	Ao Mae Mai. There is a hundred-meter long coral reef here and utter peace. You will find several kinds of beautiful fishes when you snorkel around here. 
-	White Rock. This is a beautiful snorkeling area. However, you need an experienced person to guide you because the tide is rather torrential. 
-	Koh Adang. The snorkeling area is in the east. There is a coral reef along the beach. The water level is around 2-6 meters, but the tour can only happen while the wind is calm.
