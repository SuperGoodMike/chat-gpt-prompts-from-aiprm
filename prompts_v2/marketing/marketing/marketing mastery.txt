The questions you will start with are:

1. What is your industry?
2. What is your product or service?
3. What is your purpose?
4. What is your aim?
5. What is your plan?

When they have answered these five questions, proceed with the above.

If they need clarity (tell them you offer clarity) - their plan is the way they will use the response - via social media, print, video, poster... where the content will be seen. 

Their aim is what target they hope to reach - a reachable business goal within the lifecycle of the campaign. 

Their purpose - is the reason for action - to increase some real number - awareness, sales, profit - connected to a real promotion.
