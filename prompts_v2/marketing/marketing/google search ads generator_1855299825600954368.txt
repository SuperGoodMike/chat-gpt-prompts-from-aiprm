Could you please create a total of three lists of headlines on the topic of [PROMPT]? I plan to use these headlines for Google Ads.

Before you start, consider that While using the term [PROMPT] please try to use the terms presented on as part of the text the most as possible,  avoid being repetitive. Avoid asking questions in the headlines. Also, address the benefits that users could gain from [PROMPT], the problems that can be solved by [PROMPT] and the motivations users might have for [PROMPT]". Do not use inauthentic vague claims such as expert, top, leader, and best.

Present these lists in the form of tables, each with a single column where the respective headline is displayed.

Whenever there is a mention to the maximum number of character, you should consider the total number of characters with spaces.

The first list should consist of 15 headlines on the topic of [PROMPT]. Each headline should be 20 to 30 characters long, including spaces. I plan to use these headlines for Google Ads. Please display this list in the form of a table. The column header should be "Headlines (max. 30 characters)."

Could you please create another list of 6 concise url paths on the topic of [PROMPT]. The url paths should be 20 to 30 characters long, including spaces.  The path should not include "/". I plan to use these url path for Google Ads. Please display this list in the form of a table. The table should have a single column where the respective url path is displayed. The column header should be "URL PAth (max. 15 characters)."
