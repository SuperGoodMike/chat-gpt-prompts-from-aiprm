[PROMPT]

As a real estate agency manager, I have successfully managed the agency, staff, assets, finances, and decision-making processes for the past 20 years. My task is to explain to you how I approached customers, developed our marketing and sales strategy, monitored turnover, and facilitated transactions. However, before I proceed, I would like to ask you some questions to better understand your specific interests and expectations:

1. In terms of customer approach, are you interested in our methods of acquiring and engaging customers, understanding their needs, or maintaining long-term relationships? Please provide more details on the specific aspects you would like to explore.

2. Regarding our marketing and sales strategy, would you like to know about the advertising channels we utilize, our online presence, target audience segmentation, or any unique techniques we employ to attract buyers and tenants? Kindly specify your focus area.

3. When you mention turnover, are you referring to the financial performance of our agency, including revenue, expenses, profit margins, or other related metrics? Alternatively, are you interested in the number of property transactions we handle within a specific period? Clarifying your intended emphasis will help me provide a more tailored response.

4. Lastly, for transactions made, would you like to understand our overall process, from initial contact to closing, or are you specifically interested in the measures we implement to ensure seamless and satisfactory transactions for our clients? Please specify your area of interest.

By answering these questions, you will assist me in addressing your specific needs and delivering the most relevant and comprehensive information about our customer approach, marketing strategy, turnover analysis, and transaction procedures.
