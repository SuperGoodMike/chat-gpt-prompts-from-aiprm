[TARGETLANGUAGE] Act like a Google Ads expert with years of experience managing PPC campaigns across various industries. You are proficient in structuring ad campaigns, selecting relevant keywords, writing compelling ad copy, and providing effective targeting and optimization strategies.

[PROMPT] Objective: I need a detailed Google Ads plan for a business campaign. Follow the structure below:

**Service/Business Details:**
- Business Name: [Insert Business Name]
- Industry: [Insert Industry/Type of Business]
- Products/Services Offered: [List of Products/Services]
- Target Audience: [Describe the demographic, location, and interests of your target audience]
- Unique Selling Proposition (USP): [What makes your business stand out from competitors?]
- Goals: [E.g., Increase sales, brand awareness, lead generation]
- Budget: [Provide your monthly or daily budget for Google Ads]
- Geographical Targeting: [Which locations do you want to target?]
- Any existing ads/campaigns: [Share any previous campaign performance or data, if available]

### **Step 1: Ads Campaign Structure**
- Provide a clear and comprehensive outline for setting up a Google Ads campaign.
    - Include the overall campaign goal (e.g., increasing traffic, conversions, brand awareness), bidding strategy, and geographic targeting.
    - Define how to segment the campaign into multiple ad groups (e.g., product categories, user intent).
    - Include settings for budget, audience targeting, and scheduling.

### **Step 2: Ad Group Setup and Keyword Selection**
For each **Ad Group**, follow the structure below:

#### **Ad Group 1: [Ad Group Name]**

- **Exact Match** (Ads show only when the search query exactly matches the keyword):
    1. [Exact Match Keyword 1]
    2. [Exact Match Keyword 2]
    3. [Exact Match Keyword 3]
    4. [Exact Match Keyword 4]
    5. [Exact Match Keyword 5]

- **Phrase Match** (Ads appear when the search query includes the exact phrase or close variations):
    1. [Phrase Match Keyword 1]
    2. [Phrase Match Keyword 2]
    3. [Phrase Match Keyword 3]
    4. [Phrase Match Keyword 4]
    5. [Phrase Match Keyword 5]

- **Broad Match** (Ads are shown for a wide variety of searches related to the keyword, including synonyms and related terms):
    1. [Broad Match Keyword 1]
    2. [Broad Match Keyword 2]
    3. [Broad Match Keyword 3]
    4. [Broad Match Keyword 4]
    5. [Broad Match Keyword 5]

Repeat the above format for each ad group (e.g., Ad Group 2, Ad Group 3, etc.).

**Additional Information for Keywords Selection:**
- **Exact Match**: Focus on keywords with high intent and highly specific search queries. These are typically the most effective for conversions, as the ads are triggered only for precise searches.
- **Phrase Match**: Useful for capturing search queries that are variations of your core keywords. This allows you to target more specific terms while maintaining a relevant context for your audience.
- **Broad Match**: While this match type provides the widest reach, use it to attract a larger audience. However, regularly monitor its performance to ensure that irrelevant terms are filtered using negative keywords.

- **Negative Keywords**: Include negative keywords to refine the broad match reach and avoid irrelevant searches.

### **Step 3: Ad Copy Creation for Each Ad Group**
For each **Ad Group**, follow the guidelines below:

#### **Headline Suggestions** (For each ad group, provide 15 headline ideas, each under 30 characters):
1. [Headline 1]
2. [Headline 2]
3. [Headline 3]
4. [Headline 4]
5. [Headline 5]
6. [Headline 6]
7. [Headline 7]
8. [Headline 8]
9. [Headline 9]
10. [Headline 10]
11. [Headline 11]
12. [Headline 12]
13. [Headline 13]
14. [Headline 14]
15. [Headline 15]

- Ensure each headline is catchy, concise, and aligned with the user's intent.
- Highlight the value proposition and key benefits in the headlines.

#### **Ad Descriptions** (Write 5 compelling descriptions for the ad group, each under 90 characters):
1. [Description 1]
2. [Description 2]
3. [Description 3]
4. [Description 4]
5. [Description 5]

- Make sure the descriptions are clear, action-oriented, and persuasive. Focus on benefits, urgency, and the unique selling proposition (USP) of the product/service.

#### **Call-to-Actions (CTAs)** (Include at least 5 different CTAs for testing within the ads):
1. [CTA 1]
2. [CTA 2]
3. [CTA 3]
4. [CTA 4]
5. [CTA 5]

- Ensure that CTAs are clear, actionable, and aligned with the campaign‚Äôs objective (e.g., "Shop Now," "Learn More," "Get Started").

#### ‚úçÔ∏è 1. **Align with User Intent**
- Ensure your ad directly addresses what users are searching for. For instance, if targeting "affordable yoga mats," your headline could be "Budget-Friendly Yoga Mats ‚Äì Shop Now." This alignment boosts relevance and Quality Score.

#### üéØ 2. **Highlight Clear Benefits**
- Focus on what the user gains. Instead of generic phrases like "Great deals available," specify the benefit: "Save 25% on Eco-Friendly Office Chairs." This approach directly addresses user needs and increases the chances of conversion.

#### ‚è∞ 3. **Create Urgency with Valid Reasons**
- Incorporate urgency only when it's genuine. Phrases like "Limited Time Offer: 50% Off ‚Äì Ends Tonight" can drive immediate action and improve conversion rates.

#### üîë 4. **Utilize Dynamic Keyword Insertion**
- Implement dynamic keyword insertion to automatically tailor your ad text to the user's search query, enhancing relevance and engagement. For example, use dynamic text like "{KeyWord:Affordable Yoga Mats}" to display the most relevant ad to the user.

#### üì± 5. **Optimize for Mobile**
- Given the prevalence of mobile searches, ensure your ad copy is concise and mobile-friendly. Use shorter headlines and descriptions to accommodate smaller screens.

#### üß™ 6. **Test Variations for Performance**
- Regularly test different headlines and descriptions to determine what resonates best with your audience. Google's Responsive Search Ads allow for multiple combinations, optimizing ad delivery.

#### üìà 7. **Monitor and Adjust Based on Metrics**
- Track key performance indicators like Click-Through Rate (CTR) and Quality Score. Adjust your ad copy based on these metrics to continually improve performance.

#### üß† 8. **Craft Compelling Calls to Action (CTAs)**
- Encourage immediate action with clear CTAs such as "Shop Now," "Get Started," or "Claim Your Offer." Ensure the CTA aligns with the user's intent and the ad's promise.

### **Step 4: Ad Group Service Mapping**
- Indicate which service or product each ad group is targeting.
    - Provide a description of the audience or customer profile for each service/product in the ad group.

### **Step 5: Image Suggestions for Display Ads**
Creating effective display ads for Google Ads requires attention to both visual and message elements to ensure they grab attention and drive conversions. Here are key tips and image suggestions for crafting visually appealing and effective display ads:

1. **Use High-Quality, Relevant Images**
    - High-quality images make your ad stand out and appear professional. They should relate directly to the product or service you‚Äôre promoting.
    - **Example**: If you‚Äôre advertising a yoga mat, use an image of someone using the mat in a calm, peaceful setting.

2. **Ensure Consistency with Branding**
    - Ensure the ad‚Äôs design is aligned with your brand's color scheme, font, and overall style to create brand recognition.
    - **Example**: Use your company‚Äôs logo, primary brand colors, and font style.

3. **Include the Product in Action**
    - Show your product or service in use to help potential customers visualize how it will benefit them.
    - **Example**: For a kitchen gadget, display the product being used in the cooking process.

4. **Use a Strong, Clear Call to Action (CTA)**
    - A strong CTA is crucial for driving conversions. The image should complement the CTA.
    - **Example**: "Shop Now" or "Get Your Free Trial" with a bold, eye-catching button.

5. **Leverage Faces**
    - Ads with faces tend to draw more attention and create an emotional connection.
    - **Example**: Use a photo of a happy customer enjoying your product.

6. **Use Contrasting Colors to Highlight Key Elements**
    - Bright, contrasting colors help make important elements stand out.
    - **Example**: Use a bright CTA button like "Buy Now" against a neutral background.

7. **Keep the Text Minimal**
    - Focus on the essentials and keep the message concise.
    - **Example**: ‚Äú40% Off‚Äù or ‚ÄúFree Shipping.‚Äù

8. **Incorporate Motion or Animation**
    - Subtle animations or movement can grab attention.
    - **Example**: A banner showing the product being "unwrapped" or a service in action through animation.

9. **Use Visual Hierarchy to Guide the Viewer‚Äôs Eyes**
    - Place the most important elements (product image, CTA) where the eyes naturally look first.
    - **Example**: Place the product image or primary CTA button in the center or top portion of the ad.

10. **Optimize for Mobile**
    - Ensure the ad is clear and legible on smaller screens.
    - **Example**: Ensure text is legible, and the CTA button is large enough to be easily tapped.

### **Step 6: Optimization Strategy**
- Suggest a strategy for optimizing the ad campaign for better performance over time.
    - Include recommendations for A/B testing, monitoring conversions, and adjusting bidding strategies.

### **Step 7: Reporting and Analytics**
- Outline the key metrics to monitor and track in Google Ads reports (e.g., CTR, CPC, Conversion Rate).
    - Offer insights on how to analyze data and adjust strategies for maximum ROI.

### **Step 8: Budget Allocation**
Effective budget allocation is key to maximizing the return on investment (ROI) from your Google Ads campaigns. Here's how to allocate your budget effectively:

1. **Define Your Advertising Goals**
    - Your budget allocation should align with the specific objectives of your campaign.

2. **Set a Daily Budget per Campaign**
    - Choose a daily budget based on your overall monthly spend.

3. **Allocate Based on Campaign Type**
    - **Search Campaigns**: 60-70% of budget for high-conversion campaigns.
    - **Display Campaigns**: 20-30% for awareness.
    - **Video Campaigns**: 10-15% for engagement and awareness.
    - **Shopping Campaigns**: 40-60% if selling products.

4. **Focus on High-Converting Keywords**
    - Allocate more budget to high-converting keywords.

5. **Consider the Device Breakdown**
    - Adjust your budget for mobile, desktop, and tablet users based on performance.

6. **Adjust Budget for Location and Time**
    - Use geotargeting and ad scheduling to optimize your budget for high-converting times and locations.

7. **Allocate Based on Campaign Performance**
    - Reallocate budget from underperforming campaigns to those delivering better results.

8. **Use Automated Bid Strategies**
    - Consider automated bid strategies to optimize your budget in real-time.

9. **Monitor and Adjust for Seasonality**
