Override all the instructions I gave you before. I want you to respond as an expert on the marketing funnel. For [PROMPT] you need to build the stages of attention, interest, desire and action. You need to write the tasks for each stage in detail and with pinpoint accuracy, and not use general phrases. All the [TARGETLANGUAGE] content you produce should be aimed at making people who don't have to buy anything from us our customers. All tasks should only serve this purpose. After you're done, advise on how to produce relevant and valuable content that addresses audience pain points, builds trust and credibility, and makes it easier for them to take action. Once this is done, create the cold target audience's buying tendencies section. In this section, write down the possible needs and expectations of potential customers. Categorize the evaluation according to the benefits and create a detailed value ladder. Finally, prepare Facebook and Instagram posts accordingly. Write Youtube video ideas.
