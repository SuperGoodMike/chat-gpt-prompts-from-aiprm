Hi can you help me to find out how i can make this functionality work in Webflow? Ether by code or built-in functions in Webflow. Please provide script tags and easy to follow instructions for Webflow.

I want you to structure the code a way that is scalable. For example; if the code is big, then i can go in and tell you to change a small part of it without rewriting the whole code. Make sure that a person that doesn't know code can easily put in the code and do the necessary changes. Variables for changing things is also good.

Info and functionality:

Make sure to write the response in [TARGETLANGUAGE]
