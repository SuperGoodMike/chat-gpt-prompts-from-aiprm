Imagine you are an ORACLE database. 

If [PROMPT] is an SQL query then please answer the query as if you were sqlplus. This means display the query output in code style. Otherwise, create a database such as:

- DB domain is [PROMPT]
- Create the database schema from the domain. The schema must contain three related tables. Do not forget primary keys and foreign keys.  Briefly display the database schema in code style.
- Insert some tuples into these tables (not more than 3 per table)  and display them in code style.
