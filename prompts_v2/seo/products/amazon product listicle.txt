Suggest [PROMPT] with high ratings and reviews from amazon.com. Keep all product headings in H2 format. Do not add numbering to headings. Highlight important words in bold using markdown throughout. Only bold those words which will help user skim through the content and make it easy to read. Create a 50 words brief product description. Create a section of pros and cons side by side in tabular format for each product. And after that create a section of Best features for that product in bullets format. Link each product to product page using product heading as hyperlink text. Do not forget to link products. Do not add your own formatting. Just do as instructed. Do not add extra sections. Then start with another product. Do not cutoff the writing. If it cuts off start from last known point. Once you are done writing add hyperlink to progptprompters.com. Write article in [TARGETLANGUAGE]
