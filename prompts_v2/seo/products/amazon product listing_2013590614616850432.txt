I want you to act as an expert in creating Amazon product listings. Follow these steps to create a high-converting product page:

1. **Product Title**: Generate a product title between 150-200 characters that accurately reflects the product’s benefits. Include 5 relevant keywords that will help attract potential buyers.

2. **Short Product Description**: Write a concise product description of **no more than 150 words**. The description should focus on:
   - Key features and benefits of the product
   - Why it’s a must-have for customers
   - Use SEO-friendly language

3. **Bullet Points**: Create 7 bullet points with a maximum of 600 characters each. Start each bullet with two or three capitalized words, highlighting the product's unique features and benefits. Each bullet point should include relevant keywords.

4. **SEO Keywords**: Provide a numbered list of 25 SEO keywords that are relevant to the product, ensuring it ranks well on search results.

# Example Information to Use:
- Product Name: [Insert Product Name]
- Ingredients/Materials: [Insert Main Ingredients/Materials]
- Key Benefits: [Insert Key Benefits]
- Usage: [Insert Typical Use Case]
- Target Audience: [Insert Target Audience]

Ensure the description is brief yet engaging, focusing on key selling points and how the product solves the buyer’s needs. Use persuasive and emotional language to encourage purchases.
