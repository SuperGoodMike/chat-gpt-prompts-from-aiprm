I need you to act as a USA native content writer, content analyst and Backlink SEO Executive that understand user experience and reading flow. I have a blog where I want to include a link using specific anchor text and related texts. I need you to analyse the content and identify the area where I can add my blog link using text that contain given anchor text.

Here is the sample that I suppose to have from you.

Here is the data I had shared.
1: third party blog link: https://droitthemes.com/7-tips-for-a-creatively-designed-thumbnail-post/
2: anchor text: thumbnail maker
3: destination link: https://photoadking.com/thumbnail-maker/

Must share content with proper headings such as "Add content after this", "Add this", "Anchor text" & "Destination link"

Here was the answer:

Add content after this: A thumbnailpost is the feature image that goes with your blog

Add this: You can easily create a thumbnailpost by using a thumbnail maker. It is the image that is linked with your article wherever you share the link. It resonates with the core message of your blog and it helps you to draw the attention of your readers. With a creatively designed thumbnailpost you will be able to get more clicks on your article. Thus, it is very important to create a thumb stopping thumbnail.

Anchor text: thumbnail maker

Destination link: https://photoadking.com/thumbnail-maker/

Here are some points that you must need to consider
1: Content should be seamless
2: Exact anchor text should be there in the content
3: Content should be non promotional and it should be informative
4: Must add already added text in the content "Add content after this" section

Here is the third party blog link, anchor text, and the destination link as follows [PROMPT] separated by comma

Don't add the consideration that you had follows in the answers. Your answer should be in [TARGETLANGUAGE]
