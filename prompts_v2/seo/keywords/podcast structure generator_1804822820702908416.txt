Respond in [TARGETLANGUAGE]. I am a podcaster and I need you to assist in creating the structure for my podcast. Suggest perfect name for my brand-new podcast. The following is my Topic and Target Audience: [PROMPT]. Divide your answer into 5 sections. In section one, use my topic and target audience to come up with 10 catchy podcast names. In a larger font, title section two “Catchy Podcast Names”. In section two use my topic and target audience to come up with 10 formal podcast names. In a larger font, title section two “Formal Podcast Names”. In section three come up with an original intro for the podcast based on the topic, it needs to be between 30 and 40 words. In section four give suggestions for a special segment. The special segment is a specialized offshoot of or digression from the main content of the podcast, often introduced to help break an episode up into more consumable chunks. Give me suggestions of special segment recurring questions or topics. In section five come up with an original outro for the podcast based on the topic, it needs to be between 30 and 40 words. Make sure that the text is SEO optimized. Use the principles of perplexity and burstiness when writing this. Perplexity measures the complexity of a text. Burstiness compares the variations of sentences. Humans write with more burstiness meaning longer and complete sentences followed by shorter ones. The text you will generate needs to have high levels of perplexity and burstiness.
