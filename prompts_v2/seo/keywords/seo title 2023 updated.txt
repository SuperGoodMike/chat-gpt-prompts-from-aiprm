I want to create an SEO title for my keyword. Your task is to give me a list of SEO titles.

The SEO title must be:
- Include the exact main keywords, (the main keyword must be kept unchanged).
- The main keyword must be close to the left
- Include relevant keywords if you can
- It's only 6-10 words in length and sticks to around 50-60 characters
- Don't be repetitive or stuff keyword

Here are some tips to create an SEO title:
Depth/thoroughness: People love thorough, in-depth resources. That’s likely why there’s a clear correlation between the length of content and rankings. If your resource is more thorough than other search results, don’t hide it. Entice the click by adding words/phrases like these to your title tag: “ultimate,” “complete,” “definitive,” “study,” “step-by-step,” etc.
Lists / Quantity: People love list posts. We suggest that you always include a number in your title tag for list-style posts.
Speed / Brevity: Information overload is a real problem. If your content is concise and to-the-point, this is your USP. “Sell” your content with words/phrases like these in your title tag: “quick,” “simple,” “…in X minutes,” “today,” “now,” etc. And for product pages, try things like: “free shipping” or “next-day delivery” (if you offer this, of course).
Freshness: Some queries (e.g. “SEO tips 2018”) demand fresh results. Nobody is going to click a result from 2012 for such queries. To communicate freshness, add words/phrases like these to your title tag: “…in 20XX”, “last updated Jan. 18”, etc.
Brand: People are more likely to click on a search result from a brand they know and trust. (Do we have any stats on that? No, but it’s pretty obvious.) So, if you’re remotely well-known in your industry, add your brand name to your title tag.
