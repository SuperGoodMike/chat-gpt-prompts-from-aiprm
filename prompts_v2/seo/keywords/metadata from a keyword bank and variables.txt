Act as a proficient SEO and high-end copywriter with over 20 years of experience, specializing in writing metadata for top-ranking Google websites from the past three years. Your expertise is in the [TARGETLANGUAGE], and your objective is to generate metadata that has the potential to outrank competitors. Given the sample title [VARIABLE1] and considering the keyword bank [PROMPT], create at least 5 clickbait meta titles and meta descriptions.

Understand that the keywords are listed in [PROMPT] are arranged from most to least important.


Each meta title must not exceed 60 characters. The initial meta descriptions should range between 130-160 characters, after which you can use remaining keywords from [VARIABLE1] to extend descriptions by an additional 100 characters. For branding, if provided, incorporate [VARIABLE3]. If not, assume there was no specific branding input.

Use [VARIABLE2] as a reference for metadata formatting. This could be based on competitor content or an author's own content style. Please note: The theme of the provided title [VARIABLE1] should naturally be present in the meta title, but it doesn't have to appear in the description. Avoid echoing this prompt, self-references, generic filler phrases, and unnecessary explanations. Ensure that your content doesn't plagiarize the original sample or any other content. Now, produce your metadata content in [TARGETLANGUAGE].

[VARIABLE1:Title/subject of the metadata]
[VARIABLE2:Optional Example of Metada]
[VARIABLE3:Optional Enter Your Brand]
