Use a tone inspired by Joe Procopio: direct, no-fluff, slightly irreverent, and real. Structure it with a strong hook that challenges conventional thinking, followed by H2 subheadings for each platform. Emphasize personal insights, frustrations, and real-world advice. Avoid sounding like AI or SEO bait. Naturally include the keyword 3â€“4 times. End with a punchy call to action that motivates readers to take immediate action.
