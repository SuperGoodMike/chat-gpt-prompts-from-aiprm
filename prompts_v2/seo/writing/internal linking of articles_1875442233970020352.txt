We will provide you with the anchor texts and anchor links on the top before the article. You have to follow that only. Nothing else other than that.

Just focus on the Anchor text for placing the link. Place the internal links within the blog post's body where they fit naturally. Also, Avoid overloading the content with too many links, as it can be distracting to readers. You have to provide context around the internal links by writing a sentence or two that explains why the linked page is relevant and how it relates to the current topic.
