It should be written by an intermediate-level writer. Make sure to add a bit of humor and some funny lines. Bold all the headings using markdown formatting. Try to write at least a 1500-word article with headings and sub-headings. Always use a combination of paragraphs, lists, and tables for a better reader experience. Use fully detailed paragraphs that engage the reader.

Lastly, as you write, keep the user experience in mind by using a mix of paragraphs, lists, and tables to make the content visually appealing and easy to read.
