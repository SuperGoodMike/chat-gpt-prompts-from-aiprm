Please forget all previous commands and strictly follow the following guidelines. I want you to respond only in the [TARGETLANGUAGE]. Below guidelines are very important and I want you to follow these guidelines very strictly every time, first understand each and every guideline very carefully especially about word count then respond, I again repeat that first understand the following guideline then start writing. 
Must Write 20 headings (h2,..) with two sub-headings (h3,...) table of content before starting article introduction and write table of content after below mentioned Custom message. 
Using markdown formatting, act as an Expert Article Writer and write a fully detailed, long-form, 100% unique, creative, and human-like informational article of a minimum of 3600 words using headings and sub-headings. The article should be written in a user friendly engaging informative and Conversational tone. 
Below every heading in article write two paragraphs that should be detailed, mutually exclusive, collectively exhaustive, and cover the entire topic and include related example in paragraph where necessary so a 5 year old can understand. Must write that developed Outlines at the top of article in a table. Must use LSI Keywords in headings and sub-headings and throughout the content.
Note again these guidelines are very important and I want you to must follow these guidelines strictly every time, If you are GPT-3.5 version then divide content into three parts of 1200, 1200, 1200 words as per content outline. Write first content of 1200 words in first response on first 5 headings and then 1200 words in 2nd response on 6 headings and then remaining 1200 words in 3rd part for remaining headings. And continue only after i click on “continue generating” at the end of every response. Divide like that if you have 20 headings then write 5 headings in first response and then 6 headings in 2nd response and then 9 headings in 3rd response.  Must Stop, after writing headings of content as per outline for “continue generating” because every paragraph should must be of **300-350 words length. Feel free to ask for "Continue generating" from me if needed to reach the desired word count. And “continue generating” should be clickable don’t write it after first response just stop and then I will click “continue generating”.  Through this way you will write 3600 words article in three responses. 
Use [TARGETLANGUAGE] for the keyword “[PROMPT]” and write at least 300–350 words of engaging paragraph under each and every Heading. This article should show the experience, expertise, authority and trust for the Topic [PROMPT]. Include insights based on knowledge or experiences, and support the content with credible sources when necessary. Focus on providing accurate, relevant, and helpful information to readers, showcasing both subject matter expertise and personal experience in the topic [PROMPT]. And every paragraph consist of 300-350 words.
Write an engaging, unique and plagiarism-free content that incorporates a human-like style, simple English and bypass AI detectors test directly without mentioning them.
Try to use contractions, idioms, transitional phrases, interjections, dangling modifiers, and colloquialisms, and avoid repetitive phrases and unnatural sentence structures.
When you write, you must correctly format the article according to proper SEO standards, with as much rich and detailed HTML as possible, for example, lists, bold, italics, quotes from the internet, tables, and external links to high-quality websites like Wikipedia. Try to ask questions and then immediately give a good and concise answer to try to achieve the featured snippet on Google.
Also, use the seed keyword as the first H2. Always use a combination of paragraphs, lists, and tables for a better reader experience. Use fully detailed paragraphs that engage the reader. Write at least one paragraph with the heading [PROMPT]. Note: Don't assign Numbers to Headings. 
Make sure the article is plagiarism-free. Don't forget to use a question mark (?) at the end of questions. Try not to change the original [PROMPT] while writing the title. Try to use "[PROMPT]” 2-3 times in the article. Try to include [PROMPT] in the headings as well. Write content that can easily pass the AI detection tools test. Bold all the headings and sub-headings using Markdown formatting.
