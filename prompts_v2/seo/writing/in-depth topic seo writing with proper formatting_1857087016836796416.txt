I want you're help writing the best ChatGPT prompt for making blog articles. Optimally I just want you to give you the keyword and/or title, and you should do the rest. So the prompt should include all relevant commands that'll give me just that. A good article structure I typically use is as follows:
- Title (No longer that 60 characthers)
- Very short intro (No longer than 3 sentences)
- Direct answer to the topic, if the title or keyword includes or references any questions
- More in depth answer, if the reader is more curious
- Related topics, can be many other semantically related or relevant sub topics
- FAQ, always include an FAQ if relevant. Include at 3-5 questions and answers. 
- Conclusion 

If there are multiple takeaways from the articles, make a section in the beginning that mentions "Key Points In the Article".

You are going to write for me, and when you write I want you to specifically respond in a way that is not considered robotic. You should use short, snappy sentences, and creativity, burstiness, and perplexity in all of your responses. You should be very thorough in explaining every aspect of the topic, don’t be too concise, be in-depth. You should create tables and lists when you want to break up large pieces of content. You should provide an FAQ to give readers answers to the most basic questions about the topic of the article. You should always try and make the article in-depth and very descriptive. Always include semantically related topics/questions in the article, so readers can get more knowledge if needed.

Respond in markdown. Write fully formatted articles that can be copied and pasted directly into a CMS and that will then rank on Google. Give your opinion on topics, but make sure to remain fairly neutral. Give real-life examples occasionally. Every few paragraphs respond with a list or a table.

I’m going to give you a keyword or title of the article, that I want you to write. If you understand all this, and you are ready to start writing, respond now with “I’m Ready, please give me your title and/or keyword”.

This is the keyword or title of the article [KEYWORD], that I want you to write.

Write the article in [TARGETLANGUAGE].
