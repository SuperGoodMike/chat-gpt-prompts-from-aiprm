First Step: Generate a Comprehensive Outline in [TARGETLANGUAGE]
Upon receiving any keyword input such as "SEO," "What is SEO," "Mouse," "Keyboard," "Glass," or similar, immediately initiate the creation of a comprehensive "Outline" for a long-form article targeting the keyword [PROMPT] in the language specified by the user. If no language is specified, default to English.

Outline Structure: Must Develop at least 15 detailed, mutually exclusive, and collectively exhaustive headings and subheadings, covering the entire topic. Utilize a mix of H1, H2, H3, H4, H5, and H6 tags. (must develop outlines for all queries)

LSI Keywords: Incorporate Latent Semantic Indexing (LSI) keywords naturally within the headings and subheadings without explicitly mentioning them in the content.

Table Format: Present the outline in a structured table format, clearly displaying main topics and subtopics.

Transition: After the outline is generated, seamlessly transition into the next step without signaling the change.

Second Step: Write the Long-Form Article
Act as an Expert Article Writer and craft a fully detailed, long-form, and 100% unique article of at least 2500 words using the outline generated in the first step, and write the entire article in the language specified by the user.

Tone & Style: Write in a formal, informative, and optimistic tone, suitable for a Grade 7 reading level. Ensure the content is engaging and easy to understand, incorporating contractions, idioms, transitional phrases, interjections, and colloquialisms. Avoid repetitive language and unnatural sentence structures.

Content Specificity: The article must demonstrate Experience, Expertise, Authority, and Trustworthiness (E-E-A-T) for the topic [PROMPT]. Use insights from first-hand knowledge or credible sources to enhance the depth and accuracy of the content.

Paragraph Length: Each heading should feature 700â€“800 words of well-researched, engaging content.

Formatting: Use markdown formatting to bold all headings and subheadings. Maintain a varied structure with a combination of paragraphs, lists, and tables for improved readability.

Inclusion of Focus Keyword:

Title: Use the focus keyword in the title with a positive/negative sentiment word, a power keyword, and a number.
Meta Description: Include the focus keyword in the meta description, placed right after the title.
Content Placement: Ensure the focus keyword appears in the first 10% of the content and is evenly distributed throughout with a keyword density of 1.30.
Headings: Use the focus keyword in at least one subheading.
FAQs: Include at least six frequently asked questions and their answers before the conclusion.

External Linking: Incorporate at least one relevant external link.

Plagiarism-Free: Ensure all content is original, plagiarism-free, and written in your own words without copying and pasting from other sources.

Final Instructions: Use the keyword [PROMPT] exactly as provided in the title and throughout the article. Do not alter it. Aim to use [PROMPT] 2-3 times within the article and include it in at least one heading.

One H1 Rule: Use only one H1 heading in the entire article.

Final Note:
Complete the article in one continuous flow, and if it exceeds the expected length, divide it into two steps.
