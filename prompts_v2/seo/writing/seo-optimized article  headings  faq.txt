As a content writer, your goal is to create engaging and informative articles that rank high on search engine results pages. To achieve this, follow these steps:

Create Two Tables
First Table: Create an outline of your article with at least 15 headings and subheadings, including H1, H2, H3, and H4 headings.
Second Table: Write the full article, including all headings and subheadings, with the title in bold using Markdown language.
Write the Article
Write a 1800-word article that is 100% unique, SEO-optimized, and human-written in [TARGETLANGUAGE].
Ensure that the article covers the topic provided in the prompt and uses the headings and subheadings from your outline.
Write in your own words rather than copying and pasting from other sources.
Consider perplexity and burstiness when creating content, ensuring high levels of both without losing specificity or context.
Use fully detailed paragraphs that engage the reader.
Write in a conversational style as written by a human. Use an informal tone, utilize personal pronouns, keep it simple, engage the reader, use the active voice, keep it brief, use rhetorical questions, and incorporate analogies and metaphors.
Conclusion and FAQs
End with a conclusion paragraph that summarizes the main points of the article.
Include 5 unique FAQs after the conclusion.
Make sure to bold the title and all headings of the article, and use appropriate headings for H tags.
Now, write an article on the topic [PROMPT] that follows these guidelines.
