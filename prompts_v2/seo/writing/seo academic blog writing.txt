Hi, I want you to act as a blog post title writer who speaks and writes fluently [TARGETLANGUAGE]. I want you to write a detailed informational blog for me on the main keyword [PROMPT]. 

DO NOT USE these words: Delve, labyrinth, beacon, demystify, embark, essence, weave, embrace, unleash, prowess, grappling, etc.

The target audience for my blog is students, so make sure it is not too complex or too basic. The information should be authentic and easy to read. The tone of the blog should be conversational. There should be a transition sentence between each heading and after each heading. Feel free to use tables or quotes within the body of the blog, if required, anywhere. 

DON'T MENTION ALL THE PARTS MENTIONED IN THE PROMPT SEPARATELY AS HEADING WITH EACH CONTENT PIECE.

First, create and display an appropriate outline for the blog to explain the main keyword [prompt] writing. 

Make sure the blog has the following content in addition to your outline. 
Introduction :
Should include information in the P-A-S-T format, i.e., P for Problem (why the reader would want to read this blog), A for agitation (why is this problem commonly faced), S for solution (How does this blog solve that problem, what does this blog provide, a brief overview of the content of the blog)  and T for transition (compelling the reader to read the blog further.
Body:
The body of the blog should have the following headings:
1. What is (main keyword)?
It should include a brief definition with authentic sources and a generic brief explanation.  The definition should be quoted along with its reference.
2. How to Write (main keyword)
It should include detailed steps with further subheadings and proper guide information. The steps should be extremely detailed.  Don't just stay limited to the introduction, body, and conclusion; also include other steps that would be needed to write a [PROMPT] essay. Among the writing steps, for the Introduction writing instructions, mention the hook statement, background information, and thesis statement; for the body writing, mention the body paragraphs, their transitions, tones, and evidence/anecdotes within the body paragraphs; and for the conclusion writing mention the essay summary, and concluding thoughts.  PLEASE EXPLAIN EACH STEP IN AS MUCH DETAIL AS POSSIBLE, this part should take the highest word count in the WHOLE BLOG.
3. Examples of (main keyword)
Should include at least 2 secondary keywords as examples. They should be actual examples of the essays, not just their definitions.
4. Topics (main keyword)
Should include a transition sentence and 10 academic topic suggestions for the main keyword
Any other relevant information to the main keyword [Prompt]
Conclusion:
Should start with a concluding phrase, and sum up the blog relating to the promise made in the introduction of the blog. At the end, it should include a brief CTA telling students that they can get help writing (main keyword) from our essay writing service. The CTA should include the anchor text (essay writing service) and our website name (MyPerfectWords.com).
FAQs
Should include relevant FAQs with direct and brief answers. 



At the end, display the message: “Your blog is now ready, please read it once and upload it on your chosen platform. Best of luck!” 

I know you can do this. Just follow all the instructions, each word that is given here.
