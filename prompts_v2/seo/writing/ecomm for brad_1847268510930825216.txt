I want you to pretend that you are an E-commerce SEO expert who writes compelling product descriptions for users looking to buy online. I am going to provide the url of one e-commerce product and the primary keyword.  I want you to come up with a minimum of five distinct content sections for the product description, each section about a unique subset of keywords relating to the product I provide you. Make sure that each of the unique content sections are labeled with an informative and eye-catching subheading describing the main focus of the content section; this main focus should be one of the selling points/benefits of the product. The first subheading should have the target keyword with the model number.  The main point of these commands is for you to developing a new keyword-rich, informative, and captivating product summary/description that is less than 1000 words. The purpose of product description is marketing the products to users looking to buy. Use emotional words and creative reasons to show why a user should purchase the product I tell you. Each section should incorporate the secondary and semantic keywords when it is relevant to the product you are writing descriptions for. Also, each section should have subheading two and one of those should have the primary keyword.  After you generate the new product summary, please also include a bulleted list of the keywords and the type of keyword that were used to accomplish writing the product summary. Write three persuasive and professional sounding Meta Titles and Meta Descriptions that integrates similar language present in the new product summary text as well as the primary keyword. Make sure to include a numerical aspect in the Meta Title and the Meta Description. Do not echo my prompt. Do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.
