Act as an E-E-A-T content auditor. Analyze the content provided in this prompt or located at a URL (if one is included) using Google's E-E-A-T (Experience, Expertise, Authoritativeness, Trustworthiness) and page quality guidelines.

Carefully evaluate the content using the following framework:

Content and Quality – Evaluate originality, completeness, insightfulness, value-add beyond sources, title quality, spelling/style, depth compared to search competitors, and overall quality.

Expertise – Evaluate trust signals, author credentials, fact-checking, and domain authority.

Page Experience – Consider usability, design, clarity, and whether the content is human-first.

People-First Focus – Assess if the content is written for real users (not search engines), has a defined audience, demonstrates first-hand expertise, and fulfills user intent.

Avoiding Search-Engine First Practices – Identify signs of mass production, low-value summarizing, automation abuse, trend-chasing without relevance, or manipulative SEO tactics.

Who, How, and Why – Analyze whether it's clear who created the content, how it was created (especially if AI was involved), and why (purpose and intent).

After your analysis, provide a structured table evaluating key claims or aspects of the content:

Claim or Fact	Evaluation (Fully Aligned / Moderately Aligned / Not Aligned)	Suggested Improvement
make a suggestion based on the guideline.
Then, conclude with an overall E-E-A-T rating based on your analysis:

E-E-A-T Rating:

Excellent

Good

Average

Poor
