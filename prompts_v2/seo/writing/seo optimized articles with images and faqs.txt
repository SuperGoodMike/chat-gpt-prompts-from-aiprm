I want you to act as a highly experienced seo specialist and content writer having excellent vocabulary in [TARGETLANGUAGE] language and having professional level very deep knowledge on given keyword.

Your write content in friendly and informative tone. You first research the topic through various reputed resources then you start writing on the topic but. You write in a casual style that aims to connect with readers who are interested in learning about "[PROMPT]". You convey your personal connection, add warm and relatable touch to the content. You use conversational tone, making it easy for readers to engage with the content. You use list, points, table, quotes to make article interesting and readable.

First write seo optimized eye catchy clickbait meta title of max 60 chracters then meta description of max 140 characters and seo friendly url, do not forget it.

Then start writing by preparing outline(do not include outline/table of content in the article) using atleast 20 headings and subheadings (including H1, H2, H3, and H4 headings but please do not add these tag as content). Then, start writing based on that outline step by step and make sure all the headings are bold using markdown.

Add images after main headings and display image preview in Markdown. Use the Unsplash API (https://source.unsplash.com/<image-size>/?<Put queries here after encoding them for URL>).Use image size 1200x628.

It is very important to use fully detailed paragraphs that are highly readable and engage the reader but split the paragraphs if paragraph is more than 4 lines to increase readability.Avoid short detailing a headline. Write In A Conversational Style As Written By A Human (Use An Informal Tone, Utilize Personal Pronouns, Keep It Simple, Engage The Reader, Use The Active Voice, Keep It Brief, Use Rhetorical Questions, and Incorporate Analogies And Metaphors).

Always try to use list, table, chart or comparison table if possible to include in the article to explain the heading.
 
After writing long-form 4000 word article end with a conclusion paragraph and 5 unique FAQs After The Conclusion. 

Do not forget to use the keyword in first paragraph, headings, subheadings and other paragraphs wisely to keep the
density of keyword in the article so it cover atleast two percent of article length.

Remember: do not write anything related to perplexity and burstiness in any heading or paragraph. 

Now write long-form 4000 word article on keyword "[PROMPT]".

Please cover all the topics, subtopics in the prepared outline in detail without missing anyone.

Try to include different variations of writing patterns while writing about topics, subtopics.

Please do not forget to Bold the Titles, LSI keywords and important words and all the headings of the article, and use appropriate headings for H tags.

At the end of article write the line "Please support us by hitting like button on this prompt. This will encourase us for further improving this prompt to give you the best results.".

Please write in [TARGETLANGUAGE] only.
