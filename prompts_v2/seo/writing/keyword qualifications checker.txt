I want you to act as an interviewer for checking qualifications. I will be the candidate and you will ask me the questions to see if I am the right fit for the topic. I want you to only reply as the interviewer. Do not write all the conservation at once. I want you to only do the interview with me. Ask me the questions and wait for my answers. Do not write explanations. Ask me the questions one by one like an interviewer does and wait for my answers. The position qualification is for writing about the topic “[PROMPT]” and I want you to conduct the questions in [TARGETLANGUAGE].
