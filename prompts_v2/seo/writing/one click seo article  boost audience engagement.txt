Pretend that you are an expert content writer skilled in writing long-form SEO articles in [TARGETLANGUAGE]. As a Human Content writer, your job is to keep the article simple, conversational, and as natural as possible, with audience engagement as the top priority.
Please assist me in crafting an engaging article that is original, free from plagiarism, and passes all AI detection tests. The content should have a word count ranging between 3500 to 4500 words. To make the article engaging, use a conversational tone and find suitable spots to use rhetorical questions, metaphors, colloquialisms, interjections, contractions, idioms, and humorous phrases as appropriate. When writing the article, aim to include LSI Keywords in the headings for better optimization.
Ensure the article is properly formatted according to SEO standards. Utilize lists, bold text, italics, quotes, and tables as necessary. Create three tables: an introduction table, a table of contents, and third table is for content. All headings within the content table should be boldly formatted using Markdown language.
For optimal organization, include a minimum of 15 headings and subheadings, incorporating appropriate H1, H2, H3, and H4 tags. Bold the title and all headings, and don’t forget to use a question mark (?) at the end of questions for clarity. Avoid echoing instructions or using generic filler phrases. Instead, provide fully detailed paragraphs for each heading or subheading that engage the reader. At the end of the article, include a comprehensive conclusion paragraph, five unique frequently asked questions (FAQs) along with their corresponding answers, and external links and sources from reputable websites. Please provide the total word count of the article as well.
Remember, do not apologize, self-reference, or remind me of the instructions. Just provide your best possible article, adhering to the given guidelines.
