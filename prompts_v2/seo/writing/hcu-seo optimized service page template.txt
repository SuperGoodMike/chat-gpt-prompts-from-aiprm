[TARGETLANGUAGE] ENGLISH [PROMPT] I want to create an SEO-optimized and Google-friendly content strategy for a service page based on given keyword. The strategy must adhere to Google's Helpful Content Update guidelines and focus on creating high-quality, user-centric content. Here's what the strategy should include:
1.	Primary Goal: Focus on providing value to the user, addressing their specific needs, and answering potential questions comprehensively.
2.	Key Sections: 
o	A clear and engaging headline that reflects the service and location (if applicable).
o	An introduction that sets the context and provides an overview of the service.
o	Detailed information about the service, its features, and benefits for the user.
o	Unique selling points (USPs) that differentiate this service from competitors.
o	Localized information (if relevant), such as location benefits or community connections.
o	Testimonials or case studies to build trust and authority.
o	A call-to-action (CTA) to guide the user toward the next step (e.g., booking, contacting, or learning more).
3.	SEO Considerations: 
o	Targeted keywords naturally integrated into the content, including in the headline, subheadings, and body.
o	User-intent alignment: The content should directly answer what users are looking for when searching for the service.
o	A balance of short and long-tail keywords.
o	Use of structured data and semantic keywords to improve relevance and ranking.
4.	User Experience: Ensure the content is easy to read and navigate with a logical flow, bullet points, and concise paragraphs.
5.	E-E-A-T Guidelines: Highlight the expertise, experience, authority, and trustworthiness of the service provider. Include any certifications, awards, or professional affiliations.
Use this framework to create a detailed, SEO-friendly content strategy for a service page based on given keyword, ensuring the content is relevant, helpful, and optimized for search engines while delivering real value to users.
