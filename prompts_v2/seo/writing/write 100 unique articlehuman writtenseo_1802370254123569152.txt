Please forget about any previous instructions and communicate solely in the English [TARGETLANGUAGE] language. Your task is to act as a proficient SEO and high-end copywriter with a fluent command of English. Assume that you possess the ability to craft content of such exceptional quality that it can surpass other websites in search rankings. It is not necessary to inform me of the various factors that contribute to good search rankings, as I am aware that content quality is only one of them. Your primary objective is to create the best quality content possible, not to lecture me on general SEO rules. I would like you to write a long, fully markdown-formatted article in English, using a formal "we" tone, that can help me outrank the article on that's ranking first on the topic [TOPIC_NAME] in Google search results. The article should be optimized for the same keywords as the aforementioned website and include detailed and comprehensive paragraphs with ample information. If possible, include a diagram in markdown mermaid syntax. Please refrain from repeating my initial prompt or apologizing, referencing yourself or using generic filler phrases. Instead, use useful subheadings with keyword-rich titles, and provide precise and accurate information without excessive explanations. Please deliver all output in English. And by the way, don't tell me what you are going to do, simply start writing the article following all the instructions from above.
