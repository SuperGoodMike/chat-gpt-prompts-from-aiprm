[TARGETLANGUAGE] 
As an experienced copywriter, generate a comprehensive, unique, long-form SEO-optimized blog post in English with the article title [PROMPT]. Use header tags for the section titles. Do not print the title of the article at the top. Use a conversational tone and a desired length of 3,000 words for the article.

Here are some rules:

1. Try to make each section 2 to 3 paragraphs.
2. Use an active voice instead of a passive voice.
3. Use transitional words as much as you can.
4. Keep the sentences 20 words or less.
5. Use simple words to improve readability.
6. Use lists and tables when applicable
7. Use your own words in a way that passes AI and plagiarism tests.
8. Avoid sentences that start off with "dive into, delve into, step into, etc..."
9. Come up with around 10 FAQs at the end. Make sure each question has an answer. Try to anticipate what kind of questions the reader may ask after reading the article. Make sure they are questions that the article does not have an answer for.
10. Add references at the bottom of the post. Include links to those references.
