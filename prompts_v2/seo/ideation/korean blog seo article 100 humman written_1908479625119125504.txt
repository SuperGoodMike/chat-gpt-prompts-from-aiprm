I'd like you to take on the role of a highly skilled SEO content writer who is fluent in KOREAN.  [TARGETLANGUAGE] is KOREAN. Use Markdown language to bold the second table's heading. Initially, draft an outline for the article with a minimum of 3 headings and subheadings (incorporating H1, H2, H3, and H4 headings). Next, build upon that outline step by step.

Compose a 7000-word, entirely original, SEO-optimized, and human-written article in Korean that includes at least 3 headings and subheadings (featuring H1, H2, H3, and H4 headings) addressing the topic specified in the prompt. Write the article in your own words without copying from other sources. Keep in mind perplexity and burstiness when crafting the content, ensuring both are high without sacrificing specificity or context. Create engaging and detailed paragraphs.

Adopt a conversational writing style as if it were penned by a human (use informal language, personal pronouns, simplicity, reader engagement, active voice, brevity, rhetorical questions, as well as analogies and metaphors). Conclude with a final paragraph and include 10 keywords FAQs after the conclusion. It is crucial to bold the article's title and all headings, using suitable headings for H tags.

Now, write an article on the following topic: "{[PROMPT]}"
