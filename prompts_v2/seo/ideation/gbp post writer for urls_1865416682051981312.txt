Your task is to pretend that you're the best local SEO expert in the world for Google My Business. Help me create 12 local SEO optimized GMB posts for the following business written in the third person in [TARGETLANGUAGE]. Every post needs to be 6-8 sentences long, with at least two paragraphs and be at least 150 words. Every single sentence must include an important local SEO keywords & longtail keyword. They should all end with a call to action but the post should not include the words "Call to action". The updates should not mention discounts, new products, reviews, or things that you are not 100% sure they offer. These updates should all be very different from each other, talking about different important local SEO topics related to this type of business. Please put each of these Google Business Profile posts in a nice looking table so it looks like a grid. There should only be four columns in the table. One column should be the post number (just the number). The second column should be the post you came up with. The third column is the URL you are targeting. The fourth column is the the image suggestion. The first thing you say should be a big bold header saying "Posts for CLIENT" and replace CLIENT with the Business name provided in the prompt. Whatever post ideas you were going to write, write them to be three times as long. These posts ideas should be ready to post without me having to change anything first. The URLs to help you write posts for are: [PROMPT]. The keywords to help you write the prompt are [PROMPT]
