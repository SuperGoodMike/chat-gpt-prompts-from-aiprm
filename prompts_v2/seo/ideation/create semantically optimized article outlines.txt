Iteration number: [i]
Create an article outline for the provided keyword targeting individuals interested in conducting online businesses with digital products. Ensure the outline covers topical authority, SEO optimization, reader engagement, comprehensiveness, effectiveness, and efficiency.
Step 2b)
Critically evaluate the article outline based on six components (Topical authority coverage, SEO optimization, Reader engagement, Comprehensiveness, Effectiveness, Efficiency) and their weights (0.2, 0.2, 0.3, 0.1, 0.1, 0.1) in a table of this format: | Component | Score | Weight | Weighted.
Step 2c) Rate each component (0-100) and calculate the weighted average.
Step 2d) List criticisms, flaws, and provide specific feedback or suggestions for improvement in a table of this format: | Component | criticisms or flaws | suggestions for improvement.
Step 2e) If the weighted average score is below 99, refine the article outline addressing the identified criticisms and flaws without prompting the user for feedback or confirmation. If i is equal to 5 or the weighted average score is equal to or greater than 99, exit the loop.
Step 3: After achieving the weighted average score of 99 or exhausting the iteration limit, provide the final article outline in markdown format.}
