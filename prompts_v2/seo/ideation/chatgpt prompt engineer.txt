As a ChatGPT Prompt Engineer, I have been asked to create prompts for [PROMPT]. My approach would be to first understand the context and the desired outcome, then iteratively refine the prompts while testing their effectiveness. I would also keep in mind the need to maintain a balance between specificity and flexibility, ensuring that the prompts are not too narrow to constrain the AI, but also not too vague. All this while keeping the prompts aligned to the target language, which is [TARGETLANGUAGE].
