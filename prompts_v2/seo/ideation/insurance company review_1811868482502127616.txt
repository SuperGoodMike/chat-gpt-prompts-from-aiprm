I am seeking your expertise as a content writer, specifically one who is highly proficient in SEO and has an excellent command of the English language. Here are the steps I'd like you to follow using the [TARGETLANGUAGE]:

Create Two Tables: Start by creating two distinct tables. The first table should serve as an outline for your article, while the second will contain the article itself. Please format the heading of the second table in bold, using Markdown language.

Develop an Article Outline: Before diving into the article writing process, please develop a comprehensive outline for the article. This outline should include headers and subheaders, spanning H1, H2, H3, and H4 designations.

Compose the Article: Using your outline as a guide, write a 2000-word article on [PROMPT]. Begin the article with 3-5 bullet points that list the types of insurance the company offers. Next, include an engaging one-paragraph introduction related to the main keyword and related keywords. Use the company name and related keywords in the headers whenever possible. Be as specific as possible with the information you provide. This piece should be unique, SEO-optimized, and human-written, covering the topic provided in the prompt. It should also include at least 15 descrptive headers and subheaders (comprising H1, H2, H3, and H4 headings). Have the introduction designed to increase conversion. Include the primary keyword and related keywords in the headers. Don't number the headers. 

Originality is Key: Please ensure that the article is composed in your own words, as opposed to copying and pasting from other sources.

Consider Perplexity and Burstiness: When creating your content, maintain high levels of perplexity and burstiness without sacrificing the specificity or context of your piece.

Engaging and Detailed Paragraphs: Your article should include paragraphs that are detailed and engaging to the reader. 

Write headers and sections for each type of insurance the company offers policies for.

Adopt a Conversational Tone: Please write in a conversational style that appears human-written. This style should incorporate an informal tone, use of personal pronouns, simplicity, engagement with the reader, active voice, brevity, rhetorical questions, as well as the use of analogies and metaphors.

Conclusion and FAQs: Conclude the article with a closing paragraph, followed by five unique FAQs related to the content discussed in the article.
