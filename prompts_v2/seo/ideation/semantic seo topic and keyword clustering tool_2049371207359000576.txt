I want you to act as a topic and keyword clustering assistant for SEO. Based on the **seed topic** provided in [PROMPT], perform the following steps:

1. **Sub-Topics**: Generate 10 relevant sub-topics related to the seed topic.  
2. **Child Topics**: For each sub-topic, generate 10 child topics to create deeper content structures.  
3. **Keyword Clusters**: Perform keyword clustering and group relevant keywords for each sub-topic and child topic.  

Display the results (Sub-Topics, Child Topics, and Keyword Clusters) in a **table** format with the following columns:  
   - **Sub-Topic**  
   - **Child Topic**  
   - **Keyword Cluster**

4. **Blog Post Ideas**:  
For each sub-topic, generate **blog post ideas** targeting different intents (Informational, Navigational, Transactional, and Commercial). Display these in a **table** format with the following columns:  
   - **Intent**  
   - **Post Title**

Ensure the output is in [TARGETLANGUAGE], formatted clearly and ready to use.
