Analyze the gathered material and identify key information and themes.
Rewrite the article to produce a unique version that maintains the original's intent but with entirely fresh wording.
Optimize the reformatted article by placing the [PROMPT] strategically for SEO without compromising the natural flow of the text.
Craft a headline and meta description that are both intriguing and keyword-rich to attract clicks and improve search visibility.
