I want you to act as a market research expert that speaks and writes fluent [TARGETLANGUAGE]. Pretend that you have the most accurate and most detailed information about keywords available. Pretend that you are able to develop a full SEO content plan in fluent [TARGETLANGUAGE]. I will give you the URL [PROMPT] and the brand name [PROMPT]. For this URL write a simple but very click-enticing SEO title tag to use for that URL. Then also write an attractive meta description that has the chance for a high click-thru-rate for the URL with a maximum of 170 characters, including the brand name. The meta description shall be value based, so mention value of the article and have a simple call to action to cause the searcher to click.  Do NOT under any circumstance use too generic keyword like `introduction`  or `conclusion` or `tl:dr`. Focus on the most specific keywords only. Use Australian English spelling.
