4.	Start: option explicit
5.	Declare vars first

The language supports the following built-in functions to send motor commands, queries and access (get and set) the controller configurations:
1. 	SetCommand(_CMD,cc,nn) is used to send a runtime command
2.	GetVlaue(_CMD,cc) is used to send a runtime query
3.	SetConfig(_CMD,cc,nn) is used to set a configuration value
4.	GetConfig(_CMD,cc) is used to get a configuration value
CMD must be replaced with the command to send (runtime command, query, or configuration), and underscore should be left as it is. cc corresponds to the channel (motor 1 or motor 2) and nn is the value. Note that getVlaue and getConfig do not have a nn argument since they return that value. The value can be assigned directly it to a script variable. The following example reads the motor amps of channel 1 and assigns them to the motorCurrent variable.
motorCurrent = getvalue(_A,1)
The following Runtime commands are supported through setCommand(_CMD,cc,nn) function: 
•	       VAR: set an integer user variable. User can interact through user vars from console
•	C: Change feedback counter values
•	D1: Set a digital output (has only cc argument)
•	D0: Reset a digital output (has only cc argument)
•	EX: Set emergency stop (supports only cc = 1)
•	MG: Release emergency stop (supports only cc = 1)
•	G: Send motor commands in Open Loop. Range is -1000 to +1000 and corresponds to motor voltage percentage x 10
•	S: Send motor commands in Speed mode. value in RPM.
•	P: Send motor commands in Position mode. Value in counts
•	GIQ: Send a Torque amps command (AKA Iq or quadrature amps) in Torque mode. Value is amps x 10: GIQ. 
•	GID: Send a Flux amps command (AKA Id) in Torque mode. Value is ampsx10: 
•	SFT: Give a safety stop (where the motor decelerates with a pre-defined deceleration)

The following runtime queries are supported through the GetValue(_CMD, cc) function. 
•	A: Get the motor rms current. Value is amps x 10
•	MA: Get the motor Id current (AKA flux amps) and Iq current (AKA torque or quadrature amps) current for both channels. Value is amps x 10. Cc = 1 gives Flux amps of channel 1, Cc = 2 gives Torque amps of channel 1, Cc = 3 gives Flux amps of channel 2, Cc = 4 gives Torque amps of channel 2
•	PHA: Get the phase amps of both motors that correspond to the phase instantaneous current. Value is amps x 10. cc =1 gives channel 1 phase U, cc =2 gives channel 1 phase V, cc =3 gives channel 1 phase W, cc =4 gives channel 2 phase U, cc =5 gives channel 2 phase V, cc =6 gives channel 2 phase W

•	FS: Get the controller status flags (command mode, power stage disabled, stall, limit switch, STO triggered, script running,  motor/sensor setup taking place). Each flag corresponds to a bit with the mentioned sequence. Command mode is the LSB.
•	FM: Get the motor status flags (amp limit, stall, Loop error, safety stop, fwd limit switch, rev limit switch, amps trigger, fets off). Each flag corresponds to a bit with the mentioned sequence. Amp limit is the LSB
•	HS: Get the hall sensor state. This gets a value from 1 to 6 depending on the 3 hall sensors state.

Script Rules:
•	Use while 1 main loop.
•	Use defined cmds only.
•	No floats; use multipliers.
•	10ms loop: read inputs, process, update outputs.
•	No blocking code, no blocking delays; Use counters and the 10 ms wait to implement bigger delays.
•	Always wait() in loop.
•	If cmd not listed, comment as placeholder.
