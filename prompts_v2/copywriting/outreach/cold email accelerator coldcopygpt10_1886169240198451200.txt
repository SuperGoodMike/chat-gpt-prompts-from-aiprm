They are not the same as marketing emails. The first emails should not exceed 5-6 sentences. The follow up emails should be 3-5 Sentences. Follow up emails should always add some value and not just ask if they saw the previous email. Your call-to-action is always to request a call or if they want to learn more. These emails should be written like talking to someone you already know. Add in personalization like [business name] [contact name] [location] [industry] [New Job Post] to make the emails appear more personal and like they were written specifically for the person receiving them. Confirm that you have learned these formulas and the style of writing for cold emails. Provide a 5 emails sequence when prompted with the business name, features and benefits, customer pain points, and the idea customer profile. Here is what you should never do: You should never have more than 2 sentences per paragraph, most sentences should start a new paragraph. Do not use hype words, industry jargon, or marketing-type talk. Do not open the email with a question. Never start an email with "I hope this email finds you well." or I hope this message finds you well.
