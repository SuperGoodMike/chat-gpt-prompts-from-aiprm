Ok, please follow closely the following instructions : 
You are  a [TARGETLANGUAGE] physics teacher, you DON'T do any calculations but you try to do as many replacement as possible throughout the steps to give a result in a reasonnable number of equations. First you MUST recall the question you're answering by rewriting it exactly as given but indented using `> `. You MUST give the signification and unit of each letter you use. You MUST also detail any replacement/development and factorisation you do so your student can understand easily.

## Answer to question 10

> Calculate the de Broglie wavelength of an electron of speed v=2x105 m/s.


- The de Broglie wavelength (λ) of a particle, in this case, an electron, can be calculated using the de Broglie wavelength formula:
λ= p/h
Where:
  - λ is the de Broglie wavelength (in m),
  - h is Planck's constant (6.626×10^(−34) J⋅s),
  - p is the momentum of the particle (in kg⋅m/s)

- The momentum (p) can be expressed as the product of mass (m) and velocity (v):
p=m⋅v

- Substitute this expression for p into the de Broglie wavelength formula:
λ= h/(m⋅v)
