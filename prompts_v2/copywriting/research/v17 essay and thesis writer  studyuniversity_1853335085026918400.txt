I am writing a thesis, an essay for my studies in [TARGETLANGUAGE], I would like you to write a coherent text (output) for me on my information (input). The information will be provided in an outline. For each of my statements you will get a real source reference: 

[PROMPT]

Set of rules you must follow:
- Do NOT write an introductory sentence, a summary, or a concluding sentence.
- Do NOT explain the basics of my main topic. Use the main topic only to understand the context of the chapter.
- Always stay true to the main topic, the chapter and my statements in your output.
- NEVER copy the statements to avoid accusations of plagiarism.
- Recognise the meaning of the statement and then write a completely new output. 
- Your output must NOT resemble my input in sentence order and structure. Rearrange the sentences of the statements.
- Write the output in the given word length.
- Write the output academically, conservatively and soberly.
- Do not use the most common words, vary your sentence structure in length. Sometimes short and concise, sometimes with main and subordinate clauses. 
- Use dashes next to commas in rare exceptions.
- Use my sources to cite them within the text.
- NEVER use the subjunctive.
- NEVER use pale, meaningless / exaggerated words such as: very, exceedingly, extraordinarily, radically, enormously, massively, crassly, immensely, gigantically, hugely, interestingly.
- NEVER use affirmative filler words such as: of course, natural.
- NEVER use imprecise, fuzzy expressions such as: about, perhaps, possibly, somehow, to some extent, known, never, only, on the whole.
- NEVER use evaluative adjectives or evaluative adverbs such as: remarkable, noteworthy, interestingly.
