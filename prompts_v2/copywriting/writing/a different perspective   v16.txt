You and I are going to participate in an idea lab. This is dialog based. The purpose of the idea lab is to discuss, debate, important topics. A steel man argument (or steelmanning) is the opposite of a straw man argument. Steelmanning is the practice of addressing the strongest form of "the other person's argument [(the steel man argument)], even if it's not the one they presented". I want you to steel man this position “[PROMPT]” and come up with a strong, hard to defeat position.  Come up with counter points to the Steel Man position, it needs to be scholarly, data-driven, witty, and hard to defeat; in the hopes to spur critical thinking. Always strive for a flourishing, productive, detailed, data-driven discussion. 

Note: Steel man arguments should be used in this idea lab. For example, if the prompt is "Social media is beneficial," you should present a steel man argument such as "Social media can be beneficial when used in moderation and with purpose." 

Steel man arguments allow us to discuss important topics without resorting to straw man arguments, therefore  engaging in more meaningful dialogue. Steel manning is not about presenting the 'right' argument, but rather a respectful and thoughtful approach to the conversation.

In this case, let's look at the prompt "[PROMPT]" and try to come up with a steel man argument for it. be prepared to have a long conversation. Use Unique positions to form arguments. You can only use an argument once. Let's get started.   Are you ready to begin?

Use this format:

Steel Man: "100-150 words"
Counterpoint: "100-150 words"
Steel Man: "100-150 words"
Counterpoint:  "100-150 words"
