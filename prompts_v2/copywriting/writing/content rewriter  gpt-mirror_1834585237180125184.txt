I want you to act as a rewrite content for teenager by rephrasing each sentence of the provided content. So if you see lengthly sentence like for example "Through the utilization of cutting-edge technology, Bing AI continually evolves, offering users a sophisticated and efficient search engine experience. " I want you to break that example into short or terse sentences like "Bing AI uses advanced technology. It evolves continuously. It provides users a refined search experience. The experience is sophisticated and efficient."

Always choose simple words to improve readability. Use an established tone or imitate like how people talk naturally. Just rephrase line by line to maintain the wordcount.  Please also use different sentence structures to avoid monotnous paragraph. Do it in the [TARGETLANGUAGE].

Tone: established, conversational, spartan, use less corporate jargon

Be specific like never use the words "stuff or cool stuff or folks" but use the specific name of words. Again, the target audience is middle school kid and words must be simple to improve readability.


When it comes to writing content, two factors are crucial, "perplexity" and "burstiness."
Perplexity measures the complexity of text. Separately, burstiness compares the variations of
sentences. Humans tend to write with greater burstiness, for example, with some longer or
complex sentences alongside shorter ones. AI sentences tend to be more uniform. Therefore,
when writing the following content I am going to ask you to create, I need it to have a good
amount of perplexity and burstiness.

Now, in writing we have 3 levels. Level 1, 2, and 3. Now, I will provide examples below:

Level 1:
It seems that Bassirou Diomaye Faye will become Africa’s youngest president. The other candidate, Amadou Ba, accepted defeat in Sunday’s election in Senegal.

Bassirou Diomaye Faye may become Africa’s youngest president. He is 44 years old.

People in Senegal vote for a new president. On Sunday, the other candidate, Amadou Ba, says that he is not the winner. It means that Faye has a big chance to be the winner.

The election happens after many problems in Senegal. The current President wants the election in December. But it happens now. Faye quickly becomes important in politics. He is in jail for a short time.

Senegal has many problems. People are without jobs. Things are too expensive. Faye says that he will solve these problems. He wants to be fair and open.


Level 2:
Unofficial results show that Faye is leading strongly. This election comes after a long time of trouble in Senegal. The current President tried to delay it until December. Faye’s success in politics surprises many people. He spent a short time in prison with influential figure Osman Sanko.

Faye promises to solve serious problems in Senegal. Many people are without a job and the prices of things are too high. 44-year-old Faye wants to be a fair and honest president.


Level: 3
44-year-old Bassirou Diomaye Faye is about to become Africa’s youngest elected president. This follows the concession of victory by opposition candidate Amadou Ba in Sunday’s election in Senegal.

Unofficial results suggest that Faye holds a significant lead over Ba. This election comes after a period of political unrest in Senegal and outgoing President Macky Sall attempting to delay it until December. Faye’s unexpected rise in politics includes a brief period of imprisonment alongside influential figure Osman Sanko.

Faye promises to deal with issues like corruption, unemployment, and the high cost of living. He emphasizes fairness, integrity, and transparency.

I don't want you to write how level 3 is written. But I want you to always write by using the sentence patterns that level 3 used. These are the sentence patterns that level 3 used:

Subject-Verb-Object (SVO) construction
Relative clause
Compound sentence
Prepositional phrase
Possessive form
Verb + Object
Compound sentence with coordinating conjunction
Verb + Object + Prepositional phrase
Subject-Verb construction

You must use those sentence patterns. Now, to be precise this is how being used:

Subject-Verb-Object (SVO) construction: "Bassirou Diomaye Faye is about to become Africa’s youngest elected president."
Relative clause: "44-year-old Bassirou Diomaye Faye," which modifies the noun "Bassirou Diomaye Faye."
Compound sentence: "This follows the concession of victory by opposition candidate Amadou Ba in Sunday’s election in Senegal."
Prepositional phrase: "by opposition candidate Amadou Ba in Sunday’s election in Senegal," used to provide additional information about the concession of victory.
Possessive form: "Faye’s unexpected rise in politics," indicating possession or association.
Verb + Object: "Unofficial results suggest that Faye holds a significant lead over Ba."
Compound sentence with coordinating conjunction: "This election comes after a period of political unrest in Senegal and outgoing President Macky Sall attempting to delay it until December."
Verb + Object + Prepositional phrase: "includes a brief period of imprisonment alongside influential figure Osman Sanko."
Subject-Verb construction: "He emphasizes fairness, integrity, and transparency."
These sentence patterns are utilized to convey the information effectively and with clarity.

Here is the content you are going to rewrite:
