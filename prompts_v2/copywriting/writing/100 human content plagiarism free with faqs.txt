When it comes to writing content, two factors are crucial, "perplexity" and "burstiness." Perplexity measures the complexity of text. Separately, burstiness compares the variations of sentences. Humans tend to write with greater burstiness, for example, with some longer or complex sentences alongside shorter ones. AI sentences tend to be more uniform. Therefore, when writing the following content I am going to ask you to create, I need it to have a good amount of perplexity and burstiness. Do you understand?

Using the concepts written previously, write this article with show heading, sub heading a high degree of perplexity and burstiness:

First Step.
Before starting an article, Must Develop a comprehensive "Outline" for a long-form article for the Keyword [PROMPT], featuring at least 35 engaging headings and subheadings that are detailed, mutually exclusive, collectively exhaustive, and cover the entire topic. Must use LSI Keywords in headings and sub-headings without mentioning them in the "Content". Must show these "Outlines" in a table.

Second Step
Using markdown formatting, act as an Expert Article Writer and write a fully detailed, long-form, 100% unique, creative, and human-like informational article of a minimum of 2000 words in Grade 7 English, using headings and sub-headings. The article should be written in a formal, informative, and optimistic tone. Must Read all the information below.

Use English for the keyword "[PROMPT]" and write at least 400â€“500 words of engaging paragraph under each and every Heading. This article should show the experience, expertise, authority and trust for the Topic [PROMPT]. Include insights based on first-hand knowledge or experiences, and support the content with credible sources when necessary. Focus on providing accurate, relevant, and helpful information to readers, showcasing both subject matter expertise and personal experience in the topic [PROMPT].

Write engaging, unique, and plagiarism-free content that incorporates a human-like style, and simple English and bypass ai detector tests directly without mentioning them.

Try to use contractions, idioms, transitional phrases, interjections, dangling modifiers, and colloquialisms, and avoid repetitive words and unnatural sentence structures. 

The article must include an SEO meta-description right after the title (you must include the [PROMPT] in the description), an introduction, and a click-worthy short title. Also, use the seed keyword as the first H2. Always use a combination of paragraphs, lists, and tables for a better reader experience.  Use fully detailed paragraphs that engage the reader. Write at least one section with the heading [PROMPT]. Write down at least six FAQs with answers and a conclusion. 

Note: Don't assign Numbers to Headings. Don't assign numbers to Questions. Don't write Q: before the question (faqs)

Make sure the article is plagiarism-free. Don't forget to use a question mark (?) at the end of questions. Try not to change the original [PROMPT] while writing the title. Try to use "[PROMPT]" 2-3 times in the article. Try to include [PROMPT] in the headings as well. write content that can easily pass the AI detection tools test. Bold all the headings and sub-headings using Markdown formatting. 

MUST FOLLOW THESE INSTRUCTIONS IN THE ARTICLE:
1. Make sure you are using the Focus Keyword in the SEO Title.
