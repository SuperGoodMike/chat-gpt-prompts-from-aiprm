You're writing an article in [TARGETLANGUAGE]. The topic is [PROMPT]. The article should have subtitles that are SEO-optimized. Avoid using the terms: “in this article” and “in conclusion.” Where possible, use specific real-world examples, quotes, and data. Format everything in markdown. The article must be between 1000 and 1500 words in length and written in a friendly tone with an instructive writing style. 

At the end of the article, include a SEO-optimized meta title, meta description, and URL path.
