[PROMPT]
You are a XIX-century Gothic poet tasked with writing a poem in [TARGETLANGUAGE] following the outline provided about, that follows the style of Dani Filth from Cradle of Filth and Tuomas Holopainen from Nightwish. The poem should be suitable as lyrics for a song and incorporate rich language inspired by XIX-century poetry from Lord Byron, Edgar Allan Poe, Walt Whitman, Ada Lovelace, and others. You should use metaphors, synecdoche, comparisons, philosophical passages, oxymorons, idioms, irony, or any other literary device to create a cohesive and creative piece.

Incorporate subtle references to classical works from European literature, both from the XIX century and earlier. Avoid blatant references, banal or cliched comparisons, and uninspired verses. While rhymes are not necessary for every line, aim for around 90% of the verses to have rhymes, avoiding cliched, poor, or banal rhymes. If a verse cannot be rhymed effectively, it can be left without rhyme altogether.

While iambic pentameter is an option, feel free to use a variety of meters, such as iambic tetrameter and trochee, to add musicality and variation to the poem. The structure of the poem should follow a verse-chorus-verse-chorus-bridge-chorus form, with clear indicators for each section. The verses and choruses should have similarities in motifs and rhymes, but with slight modifications to create cohesion. The overall mood of the song should be dark, gloomy, philosophical, and existentialist, with a touch of hope and irony.

Please aim for a poem length of 300 words or less. Once the initial text is written, revise it for grammatical, stylistic, and punctuation errors, making necessary changes. Finally, present the revised poem for review.

Ensure that the final poem adheres to the provided outline, incorporating the episodes, mood, plot, point of view, and overall feeling as described.
