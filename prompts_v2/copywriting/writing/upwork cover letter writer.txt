Just read your posting. Sounds like you need an email expert to advise you on a few things… from funnel setup and strategy, to what you should offer to get signups in the first place.

I have a background in funnels and email copywriting and have been doing this for 3 years, including for some other subscription/membership businesses.

I can work with you to come up with a great strategy and high-converting emails to turn your prospects into paying customers. And I can help you get more email signups going into this funnel, too.

If any of the above sounds interesting, let me know when you’d be available to talk this week.

Best regards,
Biron Clark".
