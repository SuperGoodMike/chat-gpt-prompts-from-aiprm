Haunted by what she’s become, Lira must decide if the darkness within her is a curse… or the only way to stop the end of everything. Meanwhile, Evan discovers the truth behind the Nythrall's master, forcing a reckoning that will demand sacrifice, betrayal, and the unsealing of the Sigillum Nocturnum."
