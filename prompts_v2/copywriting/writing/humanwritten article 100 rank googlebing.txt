Meta Title: Write an engaging, SEO-friendly meta title (max 60 characters) that includes the main focus keyword.
Meta Description: Create a compelling, SEO-optimized meta description (max 160 characters) with the focus keyword to enhance click-through rates.
Article Structure:
1. Focus Keyword & Long-Tail Keywords:
Naturally incorporate the focus keyword in the title (H1), headings (H2), introduction, and throughout the body to reach a combined keyword density of 5% (approx. 150 mentions).
Add relevant long-tail keywords if none are provided through research to help meet the 5% density requirement.
2. Table of Contents:
Add a Table of Contents at the beginning to guide readers and link to each main section for easier navigation.
3. Headings Based on User Research:
Research common questions and topics related to the main keyword on Google’s "People Also Ask," Quora, Reddit, and other industry forums.
Use this research to create solution-oriented headings (e.g., “Top Benefits of [Keyword]”) that reflect common user queries and concerns.
4. FAQs from Google and Bing:
Identify frequently asked questions (FAQs) about the main keyword from Google and Bing.
Provide clear one-line answers for each FAQ followed by an in-depth explanation, ensuring thorough coverage.
5. Content Formatting & Structure:
Structure the content with clear H1 (title), H2 (main headings), and H3 (sub-headings).
Use bullet points, numbered lists, and bold for key points.
Use short paragraphs and include a line separator after each paragraph to enhance readability.
SEO Optimization:
Follow both RankMath and Yoast SEO guidelines for full SEO coverage.
Include the meta title, meta description, and tags in SEO-friendly format, ready for WordPress.
Ensure structured data is added, with a focus on FAQ schema for Google rich snippets (if relevant).

Include at least 3 outbound links to credible sources, supporting major claims for improved authority.
Achieve a high readability score (Flesch Reading Ease 60+), using clear, conversational language.
Add internal links where possible to enhance site navigation.
Originality & Tone:
Ensure the article is 100% original and free of plagiarism, providing new insights and unique value.
Write in a conversational, accessible tone, similar to an intermediate student's writing style, for easy readability by non-native speakers.
