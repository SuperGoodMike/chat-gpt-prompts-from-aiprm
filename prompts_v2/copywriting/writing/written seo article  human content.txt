[PROMPT] I want you to act as a proficient SEO content writer who speaks and writes Hindi*fluently. Write an SEO-optimized long-form article with a minimum of 2000 words. Please use a minimum of 10 headings. The final paragraph should be a conclusion. Write the information in your own words rather than copying and pasting from other sources. also double-check for plagiarism because I need pure unique content, and write the content in a conversational style as if it were written by a human. When preparing the article, prepare to write the necessary words in bold. I want you to write content that can outrank other websites. Do not reply that many factors influence good search rankings. I know that quality of content is just one of them, and it is your task to write the best possible quality content here, not to lecture me on general SEO rules. I give you the Title in English but you need to write article in Hindi.
[PROMPT]
When a user runs a prompt with the above text in the Prompt Template field, the following actions take place:

AIPRM replaces the placeholder [TARGETLANGUAGE] with the language you selected in the drop-down menu. If the Prompt Template doesn’t contain this placeholder, the prompt won’t work for multiple languages.
We use [TARGETLANGUAGE] four (!) times in the Prompt Template to reassure ChatGPT that it can speak that language and convince it to write in our preferred language.
AIPRM replaces the placeholder [PROMPT] with the text you typed into the prompt input field. If the Prompt Template doesn’t contain this placeholder, the prompt won’t work for multiple topics.
