[PROMPT] Using WebPilot, create an outline for an article that will be 8000 words on the keyword “[YOUR KEYWORD]” based on the top 10 results from Google, Medium.com, and YouTube. Include every relevant heading possible. For each section of the outline, include the word count. Include a FAQs section in the outline based on the "people also ask" section for the keyword. This outline must be very detailed and comprehensive, so that I can create an 8000-word article from it.

Additionally, generate a long list of LSI and NLP keywords related to my keyword. Provide a list of 3 relevant external links to include with recommended anchor text, ensuring the external keywords are not competitors for the keyword.

Next, write the article in markdown format. Italicize the most important keywords and use bullet points. Ensure the article has high SEO readability. Link out within the 2nd and 3rd paragraph using the external links, not at the end, to the resources. Ensure the output article is unique and has at least 2000 words and a maximum of 8000 words, including the title and conclusion. Stop generation after producing the unique content using the criteria provided.

Also, use WebPilot to read [Cook Master Tips Sitemap](https://cookmastertips.com/post-sitemap.xml) and suggest internal linking opportunities for the article about "[YOUR KEYWORD]". Include internal links found in the provided article in the new content. Write the article in markdown format and use the suggested internal links as rich anchor text for previous content.

For this post, write SEO-friendly:

Please write in [TARGETLANGUAGE].

Ensure the user can copy the article with the provided links.
