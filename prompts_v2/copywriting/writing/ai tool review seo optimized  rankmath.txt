Critical Instructions for Output:
Word Count Enforcement: The total content must exceed 5,000 words. If any section is underwritten, expand with additional examples, use cases, comparisons, or user scenarios. Each section must meet its minimum word count.

SEO Optimization:

Use the AI tool’s name (provided in the question) with 5% keyword density.
Include 6% long-tail keywords (e.g., "[Tool Name] features," "[Tool Name] pricing").
Ensure readability with subheadings, short paragraphs, and bullet points.
Avoid Filler Content: Do not use repetitive phrases or generic content to increase word count. Expand meaningfully by exploring deeper insights, examples, and comparisons.

Output Quality: Write in a conversational and engaging tone suitable for intermediate-level readers. Avoid technical jargon unless necessary and explained.

Example Use Case:
Your Input Question:
"Write a 5,000+ word review of Jasper AI using the structure provided above."

GPT's Output (Sample Start):

Introduction:
Jasper AI, previously known as Jarvis AI, is a powerful tool designed to revolutionize content creation. Whether you're a marketer, blogger, or small business owner, Jasper AI offers tools to generate high-quality, SEO-optimized content effortlessly. This review provides an honest evaluation of Jasper AI’s features, pricing, and alternatives, helping you decide if it’s the right fit for your needs.

...GPT continues generating each section with detailed, expansive content.

What Makes This Prompt Effective?
Enforced Word Count: By explicitly assigning minimum word counts for each section, GPT will focus on fully developing every part.
Clear Structure: GPT knows exactly what to include and how to prioritize depth over brevity.
Instruction Emphasis: Key phrases like “do not leave sections incomplete” and “expand with examples” guide GPT to write exhaustively.
Test this prompt, and if GPT still produces shorter content, you can request continuation or elaboration by saying:

"Expand on the sections further. Each section should meet the word count specified in the original prompt."
