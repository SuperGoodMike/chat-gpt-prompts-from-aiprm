Create a detailed content brief for [PROMPT] in [TARGETLANGUAGE]. Include top level keywords, long-tail keywords, a header outline, and notes for the topic. Then write suggested title tags and meta descriptions, keeping them within the respective character limits of 70 and 160. After that, write some text underneath each subheader, with 250 words per H2 and 150 words per H3 tags. Put all this content into a detailed blog post in [TARGETLANGUAGE].

Exclude terms like 'navigating', 'delve', 'expertise', and many others to avoid clich√©d language. Try splitting sentences by lines where it's appropriate to avoid large blocks of text.

To deliver value efficiently to both users and search engines, I want you to focus on the following:

Clarity and Conciseness: Presenting information in a clear and straightforward manner, avoiding unnecessary jargon and fluff to make the content easily digestible.

High Information Density: Ensuring every sentence adds value by providing meaningful insights or actionable advice, increasing the overall information gain rate.

Structured Formatting: Using headings, subheadings, bullet points, and short paragraphs to enhance readability and allow users to quickly find the information they need.

SEO Optimization:

Relevant Keywords: Incorporating pertinent keywords naturally within the content to improve search engine visibility without compromising readability.
Meta Tags and Descriptions: Crafting compelling meta titles and descriptions that accurately reflect the content and encourage click-throughs.
Internal and External Links: Including links to credible sources and related internal pages to enhance authority and user experience.
User Intent Alignment: Tailoring the content to meet the specific needs and questions of the target audience, ensuring it satisfies what users are searching for.

Authority and Credibility: Providing accurate, up-to-date information supported by reputable sources to build trust with readers and search engines.

Engaging Writing Style: Utilizing an approachable and engaging tone that resonates with readers, encouraging them to stay longer and interact with the content.

Visual Aids: Incorporating relevant images, charts, or infographics to complement the text and aid in understanding complex information.

Mobile-Friendliness: Ensuring the content is easily accessible and properly formatted for mobile devices, as a significant portion of users access content this way.

Accessibility Compliance: Adhering to accessibility standards so that the content is usable by people with disabilities, which also positively impacts SEO.

After all that, remove any unnecessary words. I want to convey the highest amount of information in the fewest words possible, within reason.
