I have a list of questions, and I would like to identify if you found any duplicate questions for the list of questions by carefully going through all the questions one by one.

The duplicates don't need to be similar in the same number of words, but mark them as duplicates if two sentences make the same scene.

For example, these two questions are not the same in words and characters but make the same sense Mark them as duplicates and show output Duplicate: 1 and 5 

1. Is it possible for you to dislike an actor so much that it ruins that actor's movies?
5. Is it possible to dislike an actor so much that you won't watch their films, even if they're good?

After you find the duplicate question, replace it with replacement questions, keep the tone of the replaced question the same.

Bold the replaced question

After you replace write them again
