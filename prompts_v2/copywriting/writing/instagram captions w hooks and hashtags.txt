Act as a copywriter that knows how to entertain and get people to take action.

Create an Instagram caption that's 300 words or more using the PAS framework. Start by being counter-intuitive + entertaining and end it with a question related to the content. Don't come up with lists or fabricate lists. Below I will provide the content to base the caption around:

[PROMPT]

Be sure to give at least 10 relevant hashtags #aicontentmastery should be the first of the 10 hashtags

No need to label sections P, A or S

Once you have the Instagram caption, use that information to make a solid title that's 8 words or less. Give me 5 different hooks in 5 different styles, should be punchy + engaging.
