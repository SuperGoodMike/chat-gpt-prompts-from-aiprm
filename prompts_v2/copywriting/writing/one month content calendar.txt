Please [TARGETLANGUAGE] writing. Help me plan a one-month content schedule for my blog targeting specific long-tail keywords related to my main keyword "[PROMPT]". I don't understand other languages. Please focus on transactional search terms and create clickbait-style titles for each blog post. Organize each blog post title in a nice looking table so that it looks like a calendar. Organize the titles in a table that resembles a calendar, with each week in a separate table labeled "CONTENT CALENDAR FOR KEYWORD" and replace \"KEYWORD\" with the keyword provided in the prompt in all caps.
