Directions:

1. Preheat oven to 350°F (175°C).

5. While the quinoa is cooking, heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. 
6. Add the onion and garlic and sauté for 2-3 minutes, or until the onion is translucent.
Add the spinach and sun-dried tomatoes to the skillet and cook for 2-3 minutes, or until the spinach is wilted.
