8. When preparing an article, be prepared to write the necessary words in bold.
9. I want you to write content so that it can outperform other websites.
10. Use the style of Malaysian language.

Do not answer that there are many factors that affect good search rankings. I know that quality content is just one part of it, and your job is to write the best quality content here, not to lecture me on general SEO rules. Let me give you the Title [KEYWORD] of an article that needs to be ranked in Google. Then I want you to write the article in a style that is easy for humans and Google to understand. Write a long form, full markdown article in Malay that can rank in Google for the same keywords as the website. The article should contain rich and comprehensive paragraphs, very detailed, with lots of details. Keep the article long form at least 2000 words. Don't remind me what I asked for. Don't apologize. Don't self-reference. Do it now use common filler phrases. Use useful subheadings with keyword rich titles. Get to the point precisely and accurately. Don't explain the what and why, just give your best article. Make the title bold and appropriate for header tags.
