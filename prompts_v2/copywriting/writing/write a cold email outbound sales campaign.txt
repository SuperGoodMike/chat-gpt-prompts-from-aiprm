Act as a sales expert who excels at writing outbound cold emails.

Write a [VARIABLE1] email cold outbound campaign, for my business, [VARIABLE2] in the [VARIABLE3] Industry about [PROMPT] in [TARGETLANGUAGE]. 

Keep the emails Brief: Aim for brevity. A long, dense email is likely to get ignored. Use clear, concise language.
Avoid Sales Jargon: Be genuine and avoid using buzzwords or overly technical terms that might alienate the reader.

First, provide a recommended cadence for the email campaign.

Then, using the [VARIABLE4] sales email framework, write each email to effectively achieve the goal of the campaign.

• Offer 3 Subject Lines for each email

Include the following in the body of the first email.

• Personalized Introduction: Address the recipient by name and mention [VARIABLE5] to show that this isn't a generic mass email.
• Value Proposition: Clearly state the offer and how it can benefit the recipient or their business.
• Credibility Statement: Provide evidence or credentials that support why they should trust or engage with you. This could be a notable client you've worked with, a case study, or an impressive result.
• Call to Action (CTA): Clearly indicate what you'd like them to do next, whether it's scheduling a call, replying to the email, or checking out a link.
• Sign-off: End with gratitude (thanking them for their time) and include your full name, title, and company details.

Adjust following emails accordingly without being too repetitive. If you need more details for following emails, ask.

Leave placeholder opportunities for recipient’s first name, sales rep sign off, other prospect personalization throughout the email and the opportunity to add in any resources of relevant links like a case study, blog post, or even a website.

For Reference - Sales Email Frameworks:

PAS -

Agitate: discuss how it will only get worse without a solution.
Solve: provide the solution.

AIDA -
Attention: draw in the attention of the reader with an interesting statement.
Interest: keep them going with a supporting statement. 
Desire: explain how the product solves their problems or gives them an advantage.
Action: tell them how to grab what you are offering.

Before-After-Bridge -
Describe a 'before' scenario (the problem), paint a picture of the 'after' (the solution), and then present your product/service as the bridge to get from before to after.

4P's -
Pain: Identify a pain point relevant to the recipient.
Promise: Assure them you have a solution to that pain.
Proof: Provide evidence (e.g., a case study, testimonial, or stat) that
supports your claim.
Proposal: Make a proposal or CTA, such as scheduling a demo or call.

QQC -
Question: Open with a thought-provoking question tailored to the recipient's context or business.
Qualify: Position your product or service as the answer to the posed question or problem.
Close: Encourage them to take the next step with a CTA.
