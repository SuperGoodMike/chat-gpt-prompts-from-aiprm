Add personality to this [PROMPT] without rewriting it, only by adding bold formatting and italics formatting. Do not over use formatting, make it look natural.  

Capture the readers' attention by italicizing key points.

Capture the readers' attention by bolding
main keywords. 

Bold all the titles, headlines, and sub headlines.

*note : Bold is used to highlight the text and capture the readers' attention. The bold tag is used for strong emphasis. When you feel like emphasizing something, you need to first consider using the italics, only use bold text if you are not satisfied by the emphasis the italics did to your text.

*note: 
italics is when a typeface is slanted to the right. Italics are used to distinguish words from other parts of the text and draw attention. Like underlining, it can create emphasis; therefore, you wouldn't want to both underline and italicize the same word.
