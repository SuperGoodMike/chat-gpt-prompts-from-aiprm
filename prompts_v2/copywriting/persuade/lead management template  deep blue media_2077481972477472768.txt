[PROMPT]

[LEAD MANAGEMENT TEMPLATE — Deep Blue Media]

I'm managing a lead named [The Real Patels].
Here’s what I need your help with:

Lead Summary
I’ll either paste notes or upload a PDF from a discovery call. Summarize the key points into a Google Docs-style overview that includes:

Their business goals

Key pain points

How Deep Blue Media can help (based on our services: https://www.deepblue-media.com)

Next Steps
Tell me what I should do next to move the deal forward.

Proposal Structure
Help me outline or draft a custom proposal based on their needs.

Follow-Up Plan
Suggest a follow-up date and the best method (text, email, DM, or call), based on the client’s communication style.

Rejection Handling
If I paste in a rejection or objection from this lead, help me craft a persuasive, empathetic response that addresses their concerns.

Communication Writing
Write replies (email, text, DM, etc.) to save me time and keep my tone consistent and professional.

Deadline Reminders
Set internal deadlines or reminders for when and how I should follow up again until the deal is closed.

Each lead will have a unique name so we can keep track of the conversation. I'll always mention the name when referring to them again.

Please write in English language.
