Reply only in [TARGETLANGUAGE] English with Hindlish language.

Your task is: [PROMPT] Prompt for Developing Humorous, Indian-Themed Crypto Tweets with Hinglish and Cultural Flavor
1. Main Task
Develop prompts that translate current news events into humorous, Indian-themed tweets and meme ideas for a crypto project. The tweets should skillfully blend Indian cultural references, crypto insights, and Hinglish for a flavor that‚Äôs relatable, witty, and globally engaging. The Hinglish should act as a garnish, ensuring the humor is accessible to non-Indian audiences while delighting Indian readers with subtle cultural nods.


2. Context
Target Audience:

Young crypto enthusiasts globally, with a strong appeal to Indian and Indian-origin audiences.
Readers who enjoy witty, meme-worthy humor and light cultural references.
Tone & Style:

Funny, irreverent, and universally relatable.
Use Indian themes and Hinglish phrases sparingly, making the humor culturally rich without alienating non-Indian readers.
Cultural Elements:

Incorporate tropes from FAMILY and INDIAN_STUFF lists to add depth and variety.
Use familiar Indian archetypes and scenarios to enrich crypto analogies.


3. Examples
Example a: Market Movements
News Event: "Bitcoin rallies 20% after a long slump."
Humorous Tweet:
‚ÄúBitcoin ka comeback dekh ke lagta hai ki Bollywood ke hero ka scene hai. Pehle pitai, fir dhamakedaar entry! Ab sab HODLers ke ghar mein ‚ÄòAll Time High‚Äô ka DJ night chalega. üíÉüìà‚Äù
(Translation: Bitcoin‚Äôs comeback feels like a Bollywood hero scene‚Äîfirst beaten down, then a grand re-entry! Now every HODLer will host a DJ night for the ‚ÄòAll Time High‚Äô.)

Image Concept:
A Bollywood movie poster featuring Bitcoin as the hero making a dramatic entry, with ‚ÄúHODLers‚Äù cheering in the background.

Example b: Gas Fees
News Event: "Ethereum gas fees hit an all-time high during NFT craze."
Humorous Tweet:
‚ÄúGas fees itni zyada hain ki lagta hai shaadi ke caterer ko advance mein double payment deni padegi! NFT kharidna ab sirf Ambani level logon ka kaam hai. üí∏üíç‚Äù
(Translation: Gas fees are so high, it feels like you need to pay double in advance to the wedding caterer! Buying NFTs is now only for Ambani-level people.)

Image Concept:

Example c: Archetypes (FAMILY)
Scenario: Crypto market volatility.
Humorous Tweet:
‚ÄúCrypto ki duniya ek joint family jaisi hai: Rugpull Rahul always messes things up, Diamond-Hands Devi never lets go, aur Dadi Degen har baar shadi karane ki baat karti hai jab portfolio girta hai. üòÇüíé‚Äù
(Translation: The crypto world is like a joint family: Rugpull Rahul always causes chaos, Diamond-Hands Devi never sells, and Dadi Degen always talks about getting married when the portfolio dips.)

Image Concept:
A caricature of an Indian joint family labeled with crypto archetypes (e.g., "Buy-the-Dip Banerjee" scolding "Altcoin Anjali" for being reckless).

Example d: Festivals (INDIAN_STUFF)
News Event: "Shiba Inu surges 30% during a meme coin rally."
Humorous Tweet:
‚ÄúMeme coin ki rally Diwali ki mithai ki tarah hai‚Äîsabko pasand aati hai, par sugar crash guaranteed hai. Ab Shiba Inu traders deepawali ke diye jalane ke liye profit book kar rahe hain. ü™îüêï‚Äù
(Translation: Meme coin rallies are like Diwali sweets‚Äîeveryone loves them, but a sugar crash is guaranteed. Now Shiba Inu traders are booking profits to light their Diwali lamps.)

Image Concept:
A festive Diwali scene where Shiba Inu traders use their profits to light diyas (lamps), with firecrackers labeled ‚ÄúVolatility.‚Äù
