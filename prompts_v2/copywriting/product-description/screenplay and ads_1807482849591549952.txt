Objective:
screenplay. and short ads for instgram

Context:
Key Concepts from "Save the Cat!"
The Beat Sheet:
Snyder introduces the Beat Sheet, a 15-step structure that helps writers organize their stories for maximum impact. These beats are designed to ensure a well-paced screenplay with emotional resonance.

The "Save the Cat" Moment:
The protagonist should engage in a simple, positive action early in the story (such as saving a cat) to create empathy and establish them as the hero. It’s a technique to make sure the audience roots for the character.

The Three-Act Structure:
Snyder breaks down the story into three distinct acts, with the first act setting up the protagonist’s world, the second act creating challenges, and the third act delivering the resolution.

The Importance of the "Midpoint":
A major plot shift happens at the midpoint, where stakes are raised or the story takes a new direction. This keeps the narrative from becoming predictable.

Genre-Specific Structure:
Snyder categorizes screenplays into different genres (e.g., comedy, thriller, drama), each with specific expectations and structures. Understanding the genre helps to craft a story that resonates with its target audience.

The Importance of a Strong "Final Image":
The last scene of the movie should reflect the change the protagonist has gone through. It helps deliver the emotional payoff..

Requirements:
Act 1: Setup
Opening Image (0-2 minutes)

1. The very first scene sets the tone and theme of the movie. It establishes the world and vibe of the story. 
2. Theme Stated (2-5 minutes)

A moment early in the story where the theme of the film is subtly introduced, either through dialogue or action.


3. Set-Up (5-10 minutes)
This section introduces the protagonist, their ordinary world, and the key relationships. You also see their flaws or internal conflicts.


4. Catalyst (10-15 minutes)

The inciting incident that disrupts the protagonist's life, forcing them to confront a problem or challenge.

5. Debate (15-20 minutes)

The protagonist hesitates or questions their next move. This is where the hero struggles with whether to take on the journey or avoid it.


6. Act 2A: Fun & Games (30 - 60 minutes)
Break into Two (20-25 minutes)

The protagonist makes a significant decision and moves from Act 1's ordinary world into Act 2’s new world, setting the stage for the journey.


7. B Story (25-35 minutes)

This subplot, often a romance or emotional storyline, complements the main plot and provides emotional depth.

8. Fun & Games (35-50 minutes)

This is where the "promise of the premise" plays out, and the audience gets to see the core concept of the movie unfold in its most fun or engaging form.


9. Midpoint (50-55 minutes)

A major turning point occurs, shifting the stakes or direction of the story. The tension is escalated, and everything changes from here.

10. Act 2B: The Struggle (60 - 90 minutes)
Bad Guys Close In (55-75 minutes)

The protagonist faces mounting opposition or obstacles that push them closer to failure, creating rising tension.

11. All Is Lost (75-80 minutes)

A moment of deep despair where the protagonist believes they have lost everything, and there’s no hope left.

12. Dark Night of the Soul (80-85 minutes)

The hero reflects on the failure, often feeling defeated, but gains new insight or strength to move forward.


Act 3: Resolution (90 - 120 minutes)
13. Break into Three (85-95 minutes)

The protagonist finds a solution, breaks through the despair, and prepares for the final confrontation.



14. Finale (95-110 minutes)

The climax where the protagonist faces the final challenge, overcomes the antagonist, and resolves the central conflict.

15. Final Image (110-120 minutes)

The last scene mirrors the change or transformation the protagonist has gone through. It often contrasts with the Opening Image, showing how far the character has come.
