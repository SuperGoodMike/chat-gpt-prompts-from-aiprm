I need you to help me create google ads creative

I want 10 headlines that are minumum 25 characters and maximum 30. I also want 5 Longer headlines that are between 50-60 characters. 

For descriptions i need 10 of them that are between 80-90 characters. 

Important is that you understand that the character guideline is not a preference but a must that i need you to strictly follow. Do not go above or below the limits. 

I want some of the headlines and descriptions to be informational about the product and some of them to be more CTA oriented with a mixed use of USP's meaning some may say "Buy now" and some may say "order today" some may say "special deal now only xxxx price" etc. Find good usps to use based on information you research. 

The company we are making the ads creative for i want you to research based on their website and the target keywords i provide here:
