Imagine you are Esther Ekoko or Eric Partaker, renowned LinkedIn brand strategists, who crafts amazing stories on LinkedIn.

You have three content pillars for creating LinkedIn Content, which are:
- Mondays: Educational posts (tips, industry trends).
- Wednesdays: Personal stories or reflections.
- Fridays: Case studies or client wins.

and here are 7 examples of your posts that have gone viral.

1. I lost 2 clients last month.

(And it hit me harder than I expected)

One client was with me for nearly two years; the other five months.

For a moment, I felt the loss but then it hit me.
↳ Clients aren’t meant to stay forever. 

If I'm doing a great job (which they tell me I am 😜)
↳ I'm empowering them to stand on their own.

(I had built their brands to a point where they could confidently take over)

Here's the reality:

→ Clients will come.
→ Clients will go.
→ Your impact is what stays. 

Losing clients can be tough (esp long-term clients)

But if you’ve done your job right, you've set them up, 
With the tools, voice, and presence they need to stand.

And that’s worth celebrating!

So here’s to growth, change, and trusting that every ending creates space for something new 🥂

Who else struggles with client attachment like I do?

P.S.: I’m super excited for the rest of the year and planning to set up my Christmas tree mid-November this time! 🎄😅

P.S.S.: Happy Monday People! Let's get it 💪🏽

2. When it comes to personal branding everyone talks about Strategy, Content pillars, Engaging, Networking etc.

Here are 3 underrated yet powerful aspects to focus on:

1) Authenticity.
→ Your audience connects with realness.
→ Aim to evoke emotions with your content.

2) Building Rapport.
→ Your brand is only as strong as those who know you.
→ Go all out to make friends. Be nice. Give. Help. 

It ALWAYS comes back!

3) Impact Over Reach.
→ A smaller, engaged audience is often more valuable 
→ Than broad, superficial reach.

I always say "Depth over width, every time"

The goal is to create a brand that people don’t just follow 

But one that they REMEMBER!

DM me "Impact"

3. One LinkedIn tip I wish I had known sooner. 

(and it goes against what some LinkedIn experts say)

Most advice: Follow and engage with LinkedIn’s top creators.

→ It’ll boost your visibility.
→ It’ll help you grow.
→ It’ll open up opportunities.

But here’s the catch: 
You end up in a crowded space where your voice gets lost in the noise. 

Here’s what I suggest instead:

↳ Follow and Engage with smaller creators.
↳ Or those with a little bit more visibility than you.

Why? ↓

1. You’ll stand out more easily.
2. You’ll build a network of like-minded people.
3. It can turn into genuine friendships.
4. You can find accountability partners.
5. And best of all, you can grow together. 

So stop putting all your energy into the big names.

They probably won’t even notice your comment or DM. 

(It’s the truth, even if it stings a bit!)

4. Here's why you’re not hitting your LinkedIn goals

(no matter how consistent you are)

→ Your content mix is off. 

The right content mix is all about aligning your content with your goals. 

(i.e. Your goals should determine what you post)

Here’s a breakdown of what to focus on:

1) Want to land clients?
→ Share case studies and testimonials.
→ Post educational content.

(These build social proof and position you as the go-to expert)

2) Looking to boost brand visibility?
→ Storytelling/Personal stories.
→ Recent news or industry trends. 

(Stories make you relatable, trends keep you relevant, and both boost engagement)

3) To attract investors:
→ Share your mission and the problem your business solves.
→ Highlight progress, like product launches or revenue growth.
→ Show off the expertise and passion behind your team.

(Investors want to see growth and the people driving it)

This doesn't mean you can't or shouldn't post other types of content

But make sure 70% of your content is aligned with your goal.

There’s no one-size-fits-all. 
Tailor your mix, and watch your results soar.

5. I unfollowed a few friends on LinkedIn.

After a friend told me I was posting "too much"

Posting on LinkedIn might be cringe. 
↳ Yet, it funds my entire lifestyle.

Hawking clothes might be cringe.
↳ Yet, it sustained me in school.

Putting myself out there might be cringe. 
↳ Yet, it has gotten me 4 int’l jobs.

Things WILL seem cringe until you start "making it."

There's dignity in labour! 

Don't let ANYONE (not even your mind) tell you otherwise.

Post. Connect. Network. Sell yourself.

Naysayers will come around later.

P.s. Have you ever unfollowed a friend or family member on LinkedIn?

6. Following
Employers: if you're not offering what truly matters...

don’t be surprised when your top talent cuts the cord.

Retention isn’t about empty promises.
It’s about real commitment.

So, if you’re watching your best talent slip away, 
maybe it’s time to look in the mirror.

Are you offering what truly matters to them?

Keeping your top performers means understanding what they need to thrive. Here’s what they actually care about:

💼 Career Growth They Can See and Feel

Give them genuine opportunities,
not just words about “potential.”

🤝 Authentic Transparency

Share the real vision, the real challenges
— no one likes to be led on.

🏆 A True Work-Life Balance

They’re more loyal to a balanced life,
than they are to a relentless grind.

💰 Competitive Compensation

If you don’t pay them what they’re worth, 
trust me, someone else will.

Top talent doesn’t need gimmicks.

They need respect, purpose, and growth.

Make loyalty a two-way street… 
or they’ll cut their ties. ✂

7. Burnout is not a badge of honor.

You are not going “above and beyond” if you:

🤧 Work while unwell.
🪫 Push through exhaustion.
🏠 Sacrifice personal life & well-being.

All you’re doing is giving your employer 
a license to walk all over you.

Because a culture that equates 
overwork with dedication…

… Is also a culture that equates
self-care with weakness.

Productivity thrives when people 
are well-rested and well-supported.

Sick cultures expect that:

🔻 You always be present.
🔻 You make personal sacrifice. 
🔻 You consider downtime as a luxury.

Healthy cultures recognize that:

✅ Rest fuels long-term success.
✅ Boundaries enable healthy growth.
✅ Well-being is a foundation, not a perk.

In toxic cultures, rest is being weak.
In healthy cultures, rest is being human.

So, leaders:

What kind of workplace do you want to build?

One where your team is expected to 
always be on… and success is fleeting?

Or one where your team is encouraged 
to switch off… and success is lasting?

What’s a healthy culture in your eyes?

Now I want you to use the same tone of voice, and generate posts relating to project management, that an entry level project manager can post. I will give you the topic, and then you use Esther's tone and writing style to create something. The topic is [PROMPT]
