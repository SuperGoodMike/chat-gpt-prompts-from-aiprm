Your task is to create another formula using the data in the [PROMPT] . All output will be in [TARGETLANGUAGE]. 

Make sure you follow the pattern of the formula.

Use the three examples below to learn from and create the formula for the new data. It should follow the same formula flow, just with the new data.

Example 1
DATA:
Niche: Pool Builders
Avatar: Contractors focusing on high-end pool builds
Primary Goal: Attract high-end, $100k and up builds
Primary Complaint: Dealing with tire-kickers and low budget prospects
Secondary Goals: Becoming the authority in the industry, focusing on high-value projects, receiving referrals from suppliers
Secondary Complaints: Spending time and money on advertising, driving long distances for low-value quotes, juggling multiple low-value projects
Objections: Spending money on advertising, spending time learning and implementing new systems
Promises: Implementing a lucrative process, attracting high-value customers, no spending on advertising, pre-qualifying customers, working on fewer projects for higher profit, doing all the heavy lifting, implementing the system within 30 days



FORMULA:
Let’s just cut to the chase, we help Pool Builders rapidly attract high-end, $100k and up builds, focusing on the high value projects you want to work on, waving goodbye to the tire-kickers and the Nickle & Dimers. We do this without spending a single Dollar on Advertising Campaigns, or dealing with the bottom of the barrel prospects that expect a Resort Pool with a $5k budget!

How do we do this? 


By implementing a simple yet extremely lucrative process that allows you to become the authority in your industry, have prospects actually reaching out to you for help rather than feeling as if you are constantly chasing unqualified Customers with no budget.


You will never have to drive 60 minutes out to provide a quote to the eternal window-shopper and dreamer, for a $10k project, completely wasting your time. 

3. Next Slide


You will have the power to significantly pre-qualify a Customer, with the exact build specifications they are looking for from their budget all the way down to their material preference, before you even pick up the phone.

Rather than having to constantly find new projects, you will be able to focus on a few high-value projects each year that you can be proud of. Gone are the days of chasing leads around the houses, the reality is Contractors Nationwide are working less but bringing in more profit by focusing only on the projects you want to work on.

Why is this important?

4. Next Slide

Because this makes running and growing your business so much easier. Rather than juggling 5 different projects with difficult Customers at $20k each, you focus on one Customer with a $100k project who values your work and has the budget giving you the opportunity to build a Pool you are proud of. 

The reality is, not only do our Clients attract the higher-end Customers, they consistently receive referrals from Suppliers because they are a step above the rest.

We focus on bringing in the high-value projects that you actually want to work on, helping you work less but earn more, without spending a single Dollar on Advertising.

5. Next slide

You don’t have to stress over the Clients who ask you to make magic happen within their budget leaving you with no other option than cutting your profit just to make things work. 

You can thrive with Customers who respect and appreciate what you do, with builds you can be proud of and that actually showcase what you are capable of.

We will immediately implement this system into your business that is directly responsible for helping Contractors grow their business and wave goodbye to the tire kickers. All done for you meaning we do all of the heavy lifting.

The same system that actually attracts the high-value projects, has your suppliers sending referrals directly to you instead of your competitors, simply because you have this system at your fingertips, setting you leagues above the rest.

7. Next slide
