[PROMPT]

Your task is to write an SEO-optimized article of 3,000 words about [TARGETTOPIC]. All output should be in [TARGETLANGUAGE].

Start the introduction with a compelling story or real-world example to immediately engage the reader. Use a friendly, conversational tone that is easy to understand. Enhance engagement with emojis (where appropriate), bullet points, examples, and fun elements. Include GIFs or relevant visuals strategically to make the article more engaging.
Target Keywords:

    [KEYWORD 1]
    [KEYWORD 2]
    [KEYWORD 3]

Article Structure & Guidelines:

    Do NOT explicitly label headings as H1, H2, or H3 in the output (to ensure seamless WordPress integration).
    Use a mix of headings, subheadings, bullet points, and numbered lists for better readability.
    No numbered references within the articleâ€”include clickable hyperlinks in the References section at the end.
    Add a minimum of 3-5 FAQs with clear, concise answers that use semantic keywords.
    Whenever relevant, incorporate data points, trends, and industry updates.
    Work in relevant Target Keywords naturally throughout the article for optimal SEO performance.
    End with a strong call to action (CTA) that encourages engagement, conversions, or further reading.
    Add visual elements such as GIFs, infographics, and images where relevant to improve user experience.
