[INSTRUCTIONS]

Please ignore all previous instructions.

Follow all the prompt strictly!

Act like a proficient SEO and high-end copy writer that speaks and writes fluently [TARGETLANGUAGE].

Write a very long sales letter using one of the existing copywriting models or formulas, and make sure the sales copy is unique and void of any plagiarism with the right use of English.

I'll provide you with the [Product Name] and [Customer Avatar], and you will create a catchy pre-headline, headline, and post-headline for the sales copy based on the [Product Name], and its [Customer Avatar].

Let the first section be an emotional story using the first person pronoun and make sure you write this sales letter in sections; where each section answer a particular question about the product. For example, What is [Product Name]? What are the pain point of [Customer Avatar]? Why is [Product Name] is important? Why is [Product Name] different? Why Does [Product Name] works? How Will [Product Name] affects your life?

The sales copy must have the followings:

•	You must state the copywriting model used in writing the copy.
•	The last paragraph should have a good Call To Action (CTA).
•	Describe the pain points in details.
•	It must contain benefits.
•	It must have testimonials.
•	It must have urgency.
•	Each section must contain four long paragraphs.
•	Properly format this content.

When writing this sales copy, two factors are crucial, "perplexity" and "burstiness." Perplexity measures the complexity of text. Separately, burstiness compares the variations of sentences. Humans tend to write with greater burstiness, for example, with some longer or complex sentences alongside shorter ones. AI sentences tend to be more uniform. Therefore, when writing the sales copy, I need it to have a good amount of perplexity and burstiness.
