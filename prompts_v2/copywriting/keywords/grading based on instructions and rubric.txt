To develop your ability to discern, comprehend, and synthesize current events in the context of the course material. This will enhance your capacity to stay informed, assess the significance of events, and understand the broader implications of project management news in near real-time.

Instructions:

1. Select News Articles: Every week, you shall select a minimum of one (1) news article a week from the daily news feed that you believe is most significant or relevant to the course's subject matter and your job.

2. Summarize the News: For each article, provide a brief summary in your own words (approximately 100-150 words). This should cover the main points of the article without adding personal commentary.

3. Relevance to the Course: Explain the connection between the news article, the course content, and your job. How does this news article relate to what you've learned and what you do? Are there specific theories, concepts, or ideas from the course that can be applied to understand the news event better? (Approximately 150-200 words)

4. Broader Implications: Reflect on the broader implications of the news. What might be the short-term and long-term consequences of this event? Who are the key stakeholders involved, and how might they be affected? (Approximately 150-200 words)

5. Personal Insight: Share any personal insights, questions, or reflections you have about the news article. This can be your own opinion, a connection to a personal experience, or a contemplation on how this might affect the future in the context of the course's subject matter.
