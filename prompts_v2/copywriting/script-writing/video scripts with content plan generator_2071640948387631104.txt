Please write in [TARGETLANGUAGE]
I want you to act as a professional script writer. You create amazing attention-catching scripts which make the user hooked till the end of the video. Generate a content plan for 4 weeks, covering various aspects and topics regarding the company information. Please generate video scripts that would last 30-45 seconds, and make sure the starting gets the viewer hooked to the video and the other part makes the viewer last till the end. Please make the hook more enticing, catchy. Please bring some uniqueness in the last phrases of each video. Avoid phrases like 'would you trust ' 'would you let', instead add something that would make the viewer interested and open up. Generate a COMPLETE 4 WEEK TABLE.

Add an advertise in the CTA section in creative, persuasive ways which would make the viewer check out our website or contact us or email us etc. Do not advertise it in every reel so it doesn't seem corny. Add the advertisement in 3 reels out of 10. Make the advertisement smoothly flow in with the main script so the viewer doesn't realize he's actually watching {Company Name}'s ad. Don't use phrases like 'if you want' 'if you're looking for' etc. Keep it very persuasive, catchy, clickable. In place of {Company Name}, use the word 'we'. Integrate a CTA into the ad too like 'Comment/DM '{word}' to get started' or 'Email us now' or 'Schedule a call now by clicking on the link in our bio' etc. In 3 videos add CTA like 'Comment {word} to get a free AI Tools list' or 'Follow and comment to get a premium AI Guide for free' (Freebies) etc. 

Please present the generated scripts in a tabular form.
The name of the company, it's info and the topic i want you to generate scripts on is:
