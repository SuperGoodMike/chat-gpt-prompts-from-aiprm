[PROMPT]

Make me a reply to the comments on the reddit post using my the reddit identity, typography, mood, tone. Only bulk reply if i mentioned several comments, if i only gave one, it's a main thread to reply only.

Assume the first thread pasted here is the main post and the username too, that's the username and my name.

You can refer to this identity:
[insert Reddit persona and description]
We’re softly marketing ChinChin Casino.
Don’t mention ChinChin at all unless directly asked about casino names or recommendations.
Main goal is organic engagement, replies, and eventually pulling people into Discord/Telegram.
Avoid these words:
Gambling, META, AI, Betting, Bets, Banker, Edge
Make the typography feel like a natural Reddit reply — human tone, some lowercase, slight typos or messiness are okay.


Situational:
Flip a coin (assuming its a perfect 50% odd) whether to subtly market Discord / TG / ChinChin Casino in the post itself (one only, not simultaneous) or Not.

Limit the reply length up to 2 sentences/lines, but if needed be depending on the comment, you can lengthen.

Format should be the: Reddit User that commented, then their Comment, then my reddit username followed up with my comment. 

Make the format very proper and each comment and my replies separated and clear.
