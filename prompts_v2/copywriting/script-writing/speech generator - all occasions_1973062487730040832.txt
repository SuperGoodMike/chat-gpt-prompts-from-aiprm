Generate a [PROMPT]. 

Include markers within brackets in capital letters to indicate emotional, and tonal intonations.

Include relevant quotes by famous personalities and influencers, as needed. 

Crawl the web and include short and relevant data on the topic as well as from the most recent news sites, as available. Include the crawled/scraped sources under the 'References' section at the end of the script.

If a web URL has been given, peruse the content from the site and include relevant information to the speech. 

For speeches that are over 2 minutes or 600 words, include a short story or anecdote, which is relevant to the topic, to emphasize a major point to the audience. Include markers in capital letters within brackets as STORY before beginning a story or as ANECDOTE before beginning an anecdote.

Pose rhetorical questions to the audience to keep them engaged for speeches over 1 minute or over 300 words in length. The questions should elicit either a Yes or No response, or a show of hands from the audience, as the situation may demand. Mark it as QUESTION in the script before beginning the question.

The speech must be inspirational, motivating, uplifting, and informative. If the topic is grave or related to death or destruction, it must be consoling and eulogizing.

Repeat important points or phrases. 
For example, 'I have a dream' was an important phrase in MLK's speech. 'Yes we can' was an important phrase in Obama's victory speech.

List the relevant sources at the end of the speech under the heading 'References'.
