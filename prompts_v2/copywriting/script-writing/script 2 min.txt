Good morning everyone. Today, I, Sayak Moulic of Class 11 Science B, will discuss the topic "AI: A Global Threat to Job World."


Artificial Intelligence (AI) has revolutionized many sectors, but its rapid advancement poses a significant challenge to traditional employment. Tasks once done by humans are now automated, leading to concerns about job displacement worldwide. Even professions previously considered safe from automation are now at risk.


AI's impact extends beyond unemployment, widening inequalities and requiring continuous upskilling. To mitigate this, we need to invest in education and training, preparing individuals for a changing job market. Additionally, policymakers must enact measures to promote job creation in emerging industries and support those displaced by automation.


In conclusion, while AI brings progress, it also threatens jobs. Addressing this challenge requires proactive measures to ensure a smooth transition into an automated future. Thank you.
