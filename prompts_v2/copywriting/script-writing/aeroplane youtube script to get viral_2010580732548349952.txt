Explain how the flight began as expected but soon lost communication or encountered disaster.
Use visuals of the flight path, timeline, and maps where relevant.

Highlight the emotional toll on the families and loved ones waiting for news.
Segment 3: Theories and Speculations

Include expert opinions or quotes to lend credibility to the theories.
