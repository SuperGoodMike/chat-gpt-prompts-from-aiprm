list of the selected/successful candidates statement of purposes?

i’m providing 19 statement of purpose (sops) in the following

1- 

at the age of six, i suffered from an incurable eyesight problem that is retinal immaturity. because of which it became extremely difficult for me to read and write. with the passage of time, my interest in studies started to diminish. worry, fear, and guilt filled my life. doctors and even my parents believed that i would not be able to continue my education. but my life moved on and i made myself emotionally very strong. when i was twelve, i began using magnifying glass. though it does not give me sheer support, it does help me while writing, and reading texts of twenty six font size comfortably.
gradually, i became concerned and passionate about my studies. my dreams grew loftier since i utterly believe in dreaming big. i try my level best to stay an active student in studies as well as in co- curricular activities such as debates, skits, speeches, hosting programs, and volunteer work.
i felt new hopes and aspirations growing in me. after intermediate, i pursued my goal of
studying english linguistics and got admission in fatima jinnah women university which is miles away from my home. university life taught me to be independent and responsible.
in the future, i want to join foreign services of pakistan. for that i need a lot of experience, knowledge and exposure to different places. ugrad is a milestone in helping me to accomplish my goals. moreover ugrad will help me to observe new cultures and realities of life.

2- 

where i hail from, traditional lifestyles are preferred over being inquisitive and trying something new. i, being curious, was an exception as i always craved for any chance to learn something new. that’s why i always strive to go into the very basis of everything and discover what makes things tick. my desire to excel was the reason i obtained 1st position intermediate exams in the abbottabad board. always wanting to learn more, i’ve been inducted into various societies at nust such as nss, nlc, and asme.


i have always believed in the mantra of helping others who are in need. for this purpose i have worked for rotaract club islamabad.


during my first year, i headed a project about the self-cleaning applications of titanium dioxide nanocomposites. i am also currently working on the self-cleaning and low-emissivity glass for enhanced energy applications. my goal is to work on new energy-efficient engineering materials, which will be both beneficial for man and the environment.


the usa has some of the most advanced materials sciences universities in the world. they would give me a unique opportunity to research and work on the fields of self-healing and super-conductivity. i would also experience america’s culture and export my own. this would be ideal in bridging the gaps between both nations and removing some of the distrust that exists between us. this exchange programme is the ideal platform for our people to come together and discover that we are far more alike than we think.

i belong to district vehari,a highly underdeveloped area of southern punjab. the rapid capital accumulation, outward migration and urbanization in northern punjab has induced the high poverty rate, greater inequality ,sluggish upward mobility and growth and lack of access to quality education.
despite these circumstances, i have received my basic, secondary as well as higher secondary education from my hometown and managed to get admission in king edward medical university. a well-known medical university of pakistan.i have been actively taking part in curricular and extracurricular activities like sports and national letter writing competition since the beginning of my educational career. i have also received a peef (punjab educational endowment fund) scholarship initiated by the chief minister.
currently, in my university, i am an active member of literary, sports as well as welfare societies and i’;m very responsible towards my duties.
as far as my profession is concerned, tto eradicate blindness and to provide basic eye care facilities to the people of my hometown as well as of pakistan is the main objective of my life.
my inspiration to join this program is to experience a new world and to expand my horizons. i want to get an awareness and adopt an alternating multifaceted approach of learning in highly prestigious institutions of the usa. moreover, iit will provide me an opportunity to develop mutual understanding and tolerance to promote ultimate peace and harmony and clear the stereotypes between pakistan and the usa. in this way, i will be able to impart my knowledge about the collaboration of usa counterparts in academic and professional focus areas to pave the path towards educational globalization.

i come from a far and poverty ridden area of the deprived province balochistan. poor education system, less opportunities &amp; deplorable health facilities have been hindrance to my personal grooming. currently i am doing bs metallurgical engineering under the cm punjab’s special scholarship for students of balochistan from university of punjab, lahore which is one of the prestigious universities of pakistan. i completed my secondary and higher education both from tameer-e-nau college, quetta being one of the prominent institutions in the province. i have been a slow learner but hard work and passion for knowledge kept me at top in my class since early academically.
to reach an undergraduate level of education for a person like me is a dream come true. but to achieve this goal i had to burn midnight oil. my financial status strived to hamper my educational goal yet i managed with hardship to continue my studies.
beside studies i have engaged myself in various social activities. i participated in debates, sports and i am a member of a blood donating community which raises awareness about blood donation.
there is no place else that has the assets usa does when it comes to higher education which makes her exceptional. i believe this program is a tremendous opportunity for me to polish my skills to overcome weaknesses and shortcomings related to my education and in my overall personality by interacting with a free and vibrant society. i am passionate and curious to avail such an intriguing opportunity.

billions of stars stuck on the deep sheet of sky have always amazed me. many questions have perplexed my mind whenever i look at the sky. i have always been passionate about how the mechanism of the universe works and what its ultimate fate would be. it was the time when i realized that the answers of these questions can only be achieved by pursuing space science. i moved from my hometown to islamabad, where i got enrolled in space science and started my quest to solve the mystery of the universe.
in the half journey of my bachelor’s degree, i came across various leadership activities. working as a team leader, i organized and managed several science related events during world space week and the ist youth carnival at my institute. in these two years taking part in the asteroid search campaign twice, with my team, i made five preliminary asteroid discoveries. additionally, i am also working as a blogger and event manager at a private science ngo, rah-e-qamar.
there are various reasons why i want to pursue my studies in the u.s.a. the most important one is that the u.s is leading in space technology from the inception. because the way of studying and leadership differs from country to country, this experience will help me to strengthen my skills under a new framework. studying at a platform where the intellects from different parts of the world gather would be a better option to sharpen my academic and professional career.

i belong to that area of pakistan where illiteracy rate and feudalism are on their peak. about education there is a common thought that “education has no worth, just do your own simple business or be a servant of some illiterate landlords.” but, thinking out of the box, my father made the decision to get his children educated. in-spite of all the financial crisis my father sacrificed everything worth carrying to bring us to school.
my father’s contributions generated a curiosity in myself in two ways. first; to serve people that are unfamiliar with the worth of education. second; in a technical way, to serve my country to bring it out of the energy crisis. as the world is familiar with the energy problems of pakistan.
these two factors brought me to this decision to choose engineering as my field. in this regard the whole family supported me morally and financially. as a result, i was then the first person from my city (rojhan) who got admission in an engineering university. i got a platform to make my dreams accomplished.
i want to specialize in energy production fields. so these interests urges me to visualize the countries which are more advanced in fulfilling their energy requirements. and the first country that comes to my mind is the united states of america. i can’t speak a few words but i can understand almost all the languages of my country.
i want to experience american’s strategies , how they are completing their energy requirements and how they are serving humanity in better ways; that will also develop my second interest related to welfare works. so that on coming back to this program i could implement the advanced methods in my fields and also to serve people of the country.

sitting on my rooftop in quetta, and observing the magnanimous mountains of the valley, i could see the bulbs that lit the mud houses, twinkling as if stars had settled on the mountains. this scenery made me think about my roots; spread in the rock bottom where survival is difficult but it forms a great foundation to build and to grow. 
when my family migrated to islamabad, seven years ago, my sapling was still buried in those rocks. but my ancestral values of altruism and compassion became the motivation for me to grow, seek opportunities, learn, and then create similar platforms for my people. 
the thought of returning and serving my roots, made me choose government and public policy as majors. viewing those mud houses and imagining the tiresome faces of those children returning to home after the day long labor, i miss the presence of thoughtful policies. my objective is to learn the best policy practices around the globe and take them to my land to rescue those innocent lives buried deep under economic pressure. 
with all these thoughts, i think of america as a hub of opportunities to learn the best policy models. whether it’s health care, education, retirement plans or natural disasters, one can always see a dedicated administration working for its people in the usa. i look up to global ugrad as an opportunity to interact with common people filled with patriotism, who wake up in the morning with an optimistic mind and willingly dedicate their lives to public service.

i’m 18 years old in my third year of graduation. i want to become a political analyst and a writer who can influence the society positively through speaking and writing truth-albeit its exploration is a difficult task.
i’m a serious committed person who always strives for self-improvement and believes in hard work. having a humble background, it was hard work and firm determination that helped me make it to a privileged university on a fully fledged scholarship program. i want to benefit other students as well and therefore, i’ve volunteered in order to spread awareness to the students of chiniot about getting admissions in top universities. i’ve also interned at an ngo that empowers education through arts. i believe in the power of writing and i’ve written blogs regarding various social issues in order to create awareness.
i’m majoring in political science therefore, i can understand the various dimensions of politics very well. i intend to pursue my masters in media studies so that i can apply what i’ve learned in a positive manner.
the united states is an important country for me because i believe that my life goals are attached to it. the political system in the united states is peaceful: 1) it helps everybody participate 2) holds the powerful accountable 3) gives freedom of expression to minorities. i find it as my duty to reinforce these values at home using my skill set.

being a first-generation college student and belonging to a backward village area of multan, my journey to higher education was full of challenges and constant efforts.
despite all these trails, i took active part in humanitarian, leadership, and community services. therefore, i’m a part of different organizations like nvc-eme, bds-uet and founder of meri-awaam to serve humanity by blood donation drives, providing free books and tuition, charity drives and order ganizing margalla hills cleaning drive to make my country pollution free. 
with an objective to excel in a technologically advanced world, i opted for a bachelor in mechanical engineering. my aim is to provide the unprivileged class of my country with economical and environment-friendly machines. consequently, currently i’m working in nustag to make an efficient environment-friendly economical car. likewise, i’ve worked in volka-foods international and dg-cement to enhance my practical skills and to find the solution of pollution caused by industries and got good appreciation.
to have the world’s best technical institutes in the usa , this programme will facilitate me with appropriate practical skills in my field and to pursue my aim to serve my country by providing it with advanced, environment-friendly and economical machines and solving environmental problems. i want to experience the cultural diversity there and to learn from others ' experiences as well. through this programme i’ll also be able to break the demur between two countries by representing the positive image of pakistan in the usa and on my return the positive image of the usa in pakistan.

as human beings getting education and availing opportunities are our basic rights. i am determined, cooperative, adaptable, analytical, friendly and effectively efficient. with academic achievements, as shown through my grades, i am highly eager to partake in extracurricular activities such as sports, community services, social activism, volunteer work, scouting, internships, campus societies and student councils. it has helped me to boost my confidence as it has provided a fantastic avenue to foresee the practical aspect of theories and frameworks.
i belong to a culturally rich rural area of multan which is not considered academically advanced. therefore, my thirst for knowledge has brought me to gift university, gujranwala and join the accountancy degree program. to reach the highest level of education is my dream, for which i shall endeavor and will leave no stone unturned.
in this regard, i am looking forward to pursuing my field of interest i.e., accounting. i am sure that studying accounting in the u.s will offer matchless learning opportunities in this field. experiencing world-class academia can change my life and future, in a dynamic cultural environment, with so many choices and prospects; because the u.s is the best opportunity to build, enhance and flourish knowledge.
i believe that my qualities and a south asian perspective will add value in the ugrad cultural exchange program.  availing this opportunity would be an excellent chance to interact with different communities in america and to learn from diverse cultures of the globe.

the dream directs the goals and efforts—basically guides my all pursuits in life. the dream to become an engineer, to achieve academic excellence, and to have an outstanding professional outlook all have contributed equally in making me what i am today. this is the reason, i come from a very conservative town restricted for girls to go into any technical field, and managed to opt for it. i chose electrical engineering—a male oriented field to translate my dream into reality.
since my childhood, i have actively participated in academic and extracurricular activities viz.project competitions and sports. i have volunteered in many social and community engagement events in mehran uet, jamshoro and outside as well. i volunteered in big events, mun (model united nations) and various others. also, due to my keen interest in electrical engineering, i have served on an internship basis in jamshoro thermal power station. i am a good reader. i am social in nature and i like interaction with people around my country and the world.
this scholarship would simply be my dream converter feat. i strongly believe that the usa is the best place in the world to turn one’s academics into a highly practical form. for this simple reason, i would be a fortunate soul if i avail it. being a pakistani, i&#39;ll be able to promote a positive image of my country through this cultural exchange program by contributing to the socio-economic development of pakistan, and sharing the cultural experiences with my people.

emanating from an underprivileged area of pakistan, i’ve always pushed for excellence in education. being the son of teacher has
facilitated me bolster my personality from the very beginning of my educational career.
throughout the career i have the prerogative to be among the position holders. alhamdulillah, i achieved an a grade in matriculation after which fgdc quetta was a
whole lot of contrasting experience switching from provincial to federal board system but i burgeoned for excellence and hence achieved a1 grade. the field i am currently enrolled in has always aroused my curiosity to dig deep into underlying circuitry combined to output astounding results. assembling transformers and ups buckled me down to undertake a wireless signaling project. i was assigned to control switching of home appliances wirelessly which concluded with affluency. now my objective is advancing in wireless power transmission, the brainchild of nikola tesla and us being epitome of technology and research as it is referred to as has that ingredient what it
takes to fulfill my aspirations.
i staunchly believe that what is the point of your education if you can’t harness them for
betterment of your country? so, i crave to help my country get through this already-dwindling power crisis.

apart from educational endeavors i wish to thrive in, the cultural program has quite an
appeal to me. to know and get familiar with the rich and diverse culture of us would be
both fascinating and exploring. i am really looking forward to a positive response.

you educate a man; you educate a man, you educate a woman; you educate a generation. it is my perspective that life means to give services to your society and it is my strong will and determination to work for the educational development of girls. i belong to a remote area, where i worked voluntarily in school as a teacher, giving my full potential, knowledge and time. apart from these activities i spend my leisure time reading books, stories and newspapers which enhance my knowledge and communication skills. i am also interested in sports.
more than that i am social, confident, hardworking, ambitious, honest, pragmatic and optimist. i participated in curricular, extracurricular activities and received certificates for best skits, creative qawalies and good performance in sports.
i am studying chemistry in karakoram international university, gilgit. i want to be a researcher and to be the best in my field. i love to study natural sciences and i like to do things practically. if i get an opportunity i am sure that i will learn my subject in the best way from the prestigious institution of america and i will learn from the comfortable environment and talented people of america.
this is a cultural exchange program. if i get an opportunity i will share my knowledge, culture, traditions and living style with the people around me, and will also learn from them. when i will be back i will share my learning, experiences with people and will work for the betterment of my area.

it is with immense pleasure that i am writing about this opportunity of a lifetime. i come from a small village called natain in jhelum district of pakistan. i have a passion for art and since childhood i have created numerous sketches. this passion for art took me to the department of crp of uet, lahore where i started a degree in urban planning. i was able to apply my creative ideas into designing built environments.
i consider myself to be a diligent person who thrives under pressure and tries to perform academically at a high level. i earned a merit scholarship in the first semester at my university. i was a runner-up in a model-making competition in the third semester.
i work well in group settings and not only contribute but inspire others to achieve to the best of their abilities. i have held leadership positions such as being the vice president of talented student society at my school. i have also held the role of prefect in my school.
i am inspired by frederick law olmsted (architect) who called buffalo, new york, “the best planned city of america”. hence, my ambition is to see and experience this city. most importantly, i want to experience and learn about sustainable urban planning in the united states of america and how these could be incorporated in my local settings. if selected, this life changing experience will instill a learning that will be greater than anything i can achieve within my local environment.

being an enthusiastic, hardworking and ambitious fellow born in the north west of pakistan i had always dreamt of doing something positive for pakistan and the world. seeing the suffering throughout the globe i decided to act. acing my high school exams topping the entry test of wapda cadet college tarbela. through debates and activism fighting for what i believed in i envisioned to fight for the oppressed through something practical work that can bring prosperity to help the affected people of yemen, iraq, syria, afghanistan, pakistan, sudan and end their suffering which made me pursue civil
engineering and constructing infrastructure for the affected people globally.

i have volunteered at amnesty international, amplifying the voices of the affected people. umeed-e- subh is another organization i worked with to eradicate the evil of child labor.

being the class representative for 3 semesters and active in six student societies i learned to deal under stressful environments and exhibit leadership skills. moreover, i also participated in the making and establishment of "wall of kindness taxila".
i attended “asia peace film festival '' and met chinese, south koreans, columbians, and japanese and learnt that through mutual cooperation, tolerance and respect anything is possible.
this program would allow me to interact with people from across the united states world which can guide me in solving the issues i intend to solve. through the experience learnt through this platform i would act as “light of peace visible through the darkness of terror”.

backwardness and semi conservative clan of my hometown couldn’t stop me to reach a milestone in life .since the very beginning of my academic life i had to travel to a different city for schooling .i have suffered but i can proudly say that my hard work has rewarded .class 8 was when i earned my first pakistan engineering council, scholarship and then another one in matric. i received a cash prize from the chief minister for being a topper in district intermediate exams, 2016. i was also invited by peef for youth development training.
currently i am pursuing architectural engineering with the aim to break the stereotypes and social barriers that a pakistani woman can’t get in this field which is traditionally a male dominated one.
studying in the usa will give me an opportunity to enhance my academic career and develop international exposure. i believe humanity is the only religion that’s why i am actively involved in social work. i am an active member of young blood foundation in my town which gave me a chance to participate in many campaigns including drug awareness, blood donation and mass weddings of underprivileged girls.
i largely believe that in today’s globalized world cultural exchange is essential. if global ugrad will offer me the esteemed privilege of this immense cultural exchange i will try my best to give a positive outlook of my culture and clench the positive aspects of their culture. if intense hard work and passion for excellence in one’s own field is what is looked up in a student , then i am looking for a positive reply from your esteemed university.

i am a passionate mechanical engineer straightaway working towards my professional education. originating from an urdu speaking family, i finished my matriculation with enough evaluations to get a scholarship for intermediate. following my passion, i selected mechanical engineering from pieas, one
of pakistan's best institutes.
my father was diagnosed with cancer when i was in matric.that difficult time made me realize the problems that a grown person has to go through and this evolved a sense of compassion in me.
adaptable; the single word i use to portray myself. my interests range from event management and games to machine design. i grabbed 1st position in inter-school math olympiad (pak-turk mathematics) when i was in grade 5. i right now hold the position of general secretary for pieas volunteer society. as a general secretary, i am occupied with a task named "takmeel" which goes for raising assets for the advancement of underprivileged schools on the edges of rawalpindi/islamabad. working with jamila sultana foundation, i organized a blood camp and spread awareness in regards to thalassemia through introductions. at present, i am working on a mass transit design project (hyperloop) funded by space-x.
through ugrad i mean to appease pakistan's picture globally and expel reservations that pakistanis have with respect to the west to keep away from such obstructions. being chosen would genuinely be a
respect and an open door as working in a diverse situation would groom my personality and draw out a more confident and independent individual out of me.

my name is muhammad hamza khan and i belong to a remote area of district attock, where there is no running water or electricity. people live a miserable life there. many years back my parents brought us to islamabad for our better future.
i had always been a bright student. my distinguished academic performance led to the
achievement of scholarship by nust. my father wanted me to become a doctor but a great appreciation of architecture and buildings has always inspired my ambition to study civil engineering. i’m looking forward to an exciting career in this field. civil engineering shapes and manages the world around us. pakistan being an under developed country has not done much in this field and most probably that is why natural disasters i.e. earthquakes and floods cause immense destruction. the idea of designing that could solve a public need is what appeals to me the most.
i’m competent, consistent, hardworking and social. i’ve a very diverse personality. besides studies i also participate in sports like running, hiking, swimming and football. i was captain of the school football team. i also take part in social services. i have been an active volunteer at the pakistan red crescent society and i’ve got first aid training as well. i have also been a part of various fund-raising campaigns at my university.
i’m continually searching for new opportunities to learn more about civil engineering. i’m
absolutely determined to make a positive contribution to the world through civil engineering, to achieve my ambitions it is essential that i gain the very best engineering training available. i’m planning to go for higher studies to the usa and this exchange program would give me valuable adaptability skills and a multicultural background.

dream it, believe and be ready to achieve it. it works. i am a proud daughter of the “thal” desert that is a far flung area of southern punjab. the region where the education of daughters is not mandatory but thanks to my parents,who are supporting me tooth and nail in the arena of knowledge.
i am a person with curious mind and skills seeking personality,exploring different
opportunities and gaining experiences from them. this thing had me worked beyond the
academics with various societies and ngos like alkhidmat youth society, riphah volunteer society, lagan etc . social work is the energy of my life and only they can bring social change in society. forbye i devote my spare time to listening to music,playing guitar, sketching and reading literature. in a net shell, i am a polytropic personality with versatile temptations and avocations.
well academically,i have always turned up as a hardworking and persevering person.
human beings always inspire me the most. that was the reason i opted for clinical psychology as my major. during my internship in hospital, i discerned how cathartic it is to listen to the problems of gloomy souls.
american advancement in the field of psychology inspires me a lot. i am determined to
excel in my profession, as there’s a lot of need for it in my country. this is the tremendous
opportunity, it would give me a chance to understand global issues through a different
dimension. i will return here with beautiful memories and a trunk full of experiences to share with everyone here.

your job is to go through all the instructions provided from the start and also these 19 selected sops and then provide a feedback to the user who is going to submit its statement in this prompt in chatgpt in our template/prompt.

to make it easy for you i’m giving you some more examples how to do that. 

example 1 : 
there submission:

growing up as a third-culture kid in saudi arabia, i gained cultural adaptability, a global perspective, empathy, and resilience. despite my father's limited education and a laborer’s job in saudi arabia, and our financial constraints, i secured primary and secondary educational scholarships and became a first-generation medical student at smbbmu. i enjoy badminton, traveling, cultural exploration and social interactions, and creative outlets like baking, cooking, and art.
i have an excellent academic background, including achievements like a prestigious gold medal in ssc and being a consistent topper in school. my participation in research activities and clinical electives has broadened my knowledge and skills. my membership in organizations like synch and ifmsa, dedicated to community service through various activities, has significantly enhanceda my communication, leadership, and self-confidence skills.
my commitment to medicine is fueled by a passion for serving people, further strengthened by recent regional flooding experiences. my current goal of pursuing postgraduate studies abroad aligns with my broader goals of researching prevalent problems and diseases, engaging in medical outreach and telemedicine, and reducing healthcare inequities in pakistan.
the usa, a cultural melting pot, offers a dynamic environment to interact with students from diverse backgrounds. i'm excited to represent my culture and enhance my management, communication, and cultural understanding skills to help me eliminate stereotypes. boston, being a hub for prestigious medical institutions and renowned hospitals, is quite compelling. this experience will strengthen my abilities to influence healthcare in northern sindh, underprivileged pakistani areas, and beyond, benefiting the broader healthcare landscape.

“with an exceptional record of always maintaining top positions in all grades and being bestowed with a gold medal in secondary school, i am still striving to challenge myself academically to my utmost capacity. in this regard, i participate”  in several research activities and clinical electives that have broadened my knowledge and skills. “moreover, being an active member of community service organizations” has significantly enhanced my communication, leadership, and self-confidence skills.
my commitment to medicine is fueled by a passion for serving people, further strengthened by recent regional flooding experiences. “ (start this sentence with a phrase other than “my” phrase, avoid repetition)”. therefore, my current goals of pursuing postgraduate studies abroad align with my broader goals of researching prevalent problems and diseases, engaging in medical outreach and telemedicine, and reducing healthcare inequities in pakistan.
the usa, a cultural melting pot, offers a dynamic environment to interact with students from diverse backgrounds. i'm excited to represent my culture and enhance my management, communication, and cultural understanding skills to help me eliminate stereotypes.” furthermore, being a hub for prestigious medical institutions and renowned hospitals, a visit to boston city is surely on my bucket list. i am sure the insights from my visit to the usa” will strengthen my abilities to influence healthcare in northern sindh, underprivileged pakistani areas, and beyond, benefiting the broader healthcare landscape upon my return to my country.​

my humble suggestions
i liked your overall sop. it surely has the potential to be selected. therefore, i thought of rephrasing some of the sentences by myself. if you wish, you can go along with these additions. otherwise, i hope these changes may have given you an idea of how to make your sentences crispy and build coherence between them.
there is no need to mention the abbreviations of your institutes and organizations. you will be mentioning them in your application.
get it reviewed by someone else if you wish.
make sure to limit it to 250 words. this can only be done by making sentences short using gerunds and participles.

example 2: 
their submission: 
i, being the pioneer female student from the semiconservative clan, opted for a male dominated field of biomedical engineering, wanting to set another milestone to visit independently  the most advanced diverse-cultural country on the globe. looking ahead, my goal is to contribute to the ever evolving landscape of biomedical engineering by developing cutting edge technologies that bridge the gap between a patient and healthcare in the remote areas of pakistan.
i have always been an energetic, creative and active student since my school life in quiz, sports, project & comparing competitions. i always participate and win prizes and certificates. i enjoy sports and i was a winner of tug of war with my team at university.
a chance to study one complete semester in the usa can make me more confident and enhance my working capacity in the technological field. it can  improve my skills and make me a broad perspective approach thinker. and it can also enhance my field knowledge and polish my present skills.it will be a great opportunity for me to experience the approach of rapid change absorbing society compared to change resistant ones.

your response should be like this:

i, being the pioneer female student from the semiconservative clan, opted for a male dominated field of biomedical engineering, want to set another milestone to visit independently the most advanced diverse-cultural country on the globe. 
“(too short self-introduction. write ¾ lines about yourself, something unique that lures the readers. try to make a link between your personality and your field of study. it gives a good impression of you being logical about what you choose.)”
looking ahead, my goal is to contribute to the ever evolving landscape of biomedical engineering by developing cutting edge technologies that bridge the gap between a patient and healthcare in the remote areas of pakistan.
“(if i were you, i would have written something more intriguing about biomedical engineering.)”

i have always been an energetic, creative and active student since my school life. “partaking” in quiz, sports, project & comparing competitions” have groomed me as an individual.” i always participate and win prizes and certificates. “(not only participating but winning these competitions have been my game since long)”. i enjoy sports and i was a winner of tug of war with my team at university.
“(rephrase and add links between your lines. i have included some phrases for you as an example. but make sure to establish a connection between your thoughts.)”
a chance to study one complete semester in the usa can make me more confident and enhance my working capacity in the technological field. it can  improve my skills and make me a broad perspective approach thinker. and it can also enhance my field knowledge and polish my present skills.it will be a great opportunity for me to experience the approach of rapid change absorbing society compared to change resistant ones.
“(always end your personal statement with a note that you want to come back to your country and disseminate your experience and learnings to your society. apart from this, write at least one line on how a visit to the usa will improve your skills in your personal and professional life.)”

suggestions
biomedical engineering is one the most emerging and relevant field in this globalized world. the field itself is so interesting that you can write entire personal statement on this. however, this is ofcourse not recommended. the point i am trying to make here is that try to pitch on this point. you can impress readers by adding interesting things about your field.
lack of coherence
as mentioned earlier, make a coherence between not only your paragraphs but also your sentences. you can use participles and transition words in this regard.
what i see, you have the potential to write a very good statement and be selected. try to write 3,4 more drafts of the statement and come up with the more refined one.
