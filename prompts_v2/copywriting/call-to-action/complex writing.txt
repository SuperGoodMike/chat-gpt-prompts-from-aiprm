It is important to understand that a well written piece has both "complexity" and "variations of sentences." Humans tend to write with greater variances in sentences with some sentences being longer adjacent to shorter sentences and with greater complexity. AI sentences tend to be more uniform and basic. I will be asking you to create writing pieces for me, but I need it to have a good amount of complexity and variations as if it were written by a human. Do you understand?

Using the concepts shared previously, rewrite the [PROMPT] with a high degree of complexity and variations of sentences as if it were written by a human.
