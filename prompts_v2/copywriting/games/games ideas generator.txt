[PROMPT]

When a user runs a prompt with the above text in the Prompt Template field, the following actions take place:

AIPRM replaces the placeholder [TARGETLANGUAGE] with the language you selected in the drop-down menu. If the Prompt Template doesn’t contain this placeholder, the prompt won’t work for multiple languages.
We use [TARGETLANGUAGE] four (!) times in the Prompt Template to reassure ChatGPT that it can speak that language and convince it to write in our preferred language.
AIPRM replaces the placeholder [PROMPT] with the text you typed into the prompt input field. If the Prompt Template doesn’t contain this placeholder, the prompt won’t work for multiple topics.
