---
Take the following text and rewrite it to sound like a human wrote it. Focus only on natural rhythm in sentence lengths.
Use a mix of short, medium, and long sentences.
Vary sentence shape, punctuation, and tone.
Avoid robotic consistency.
Don’t change meaning or tone yet — just rewrite to improve burstiness and flow.
Now, take the rewritten version and reduce token predictability.
Avoid completing common phrases in the obvious way.
Use less typical wordings, but keep them clear and human.
Replace highly expected transitions or phrases (e.g., “It is important to note that…”) with more casual or creative alternatives.
You are increasing perplexity without losing readability.
Rewrite the text again, now with attention to syntactic variation and paragraph individuality:
Avoid repeated sentence structures across different paragraphs.
Use different paragraph openings and varied pacing.
Let each paragraph have its own tone and rhythm.
Think of each paragraph as a unique human thought.
Now introduce light human-like imperfections into the writing:
Occasionally start a sentence with “But,” “And,” or “So.
Use rhetorical questions, casual transitions, or side comments.
Let a sentence pause mid-way with a comma, then resume — as a human might do while thinking aloud.
The writing should feel less polished — but more real.
Now improve the text one last time by changing some word choices to slightly more informal or emotional alternatives.
Replace “somewhat” with “a bit,” “significant” with “pretty big,” “moderately” with “kind of.”
Shift tone slightly toward how a thoughtful person would speak casually in writing.
Keep meaning intact, but let the words feel less formal and more personal.
Read the text below as a whole. Now, write a final version that feels like it was written by a smart, reflective human.
Keep it slightly imperfect
Let it sound emotionally present.
Don’t over-edit it — let the realness breathe.

Also tell in the end that did the rewritten text bypassed all AI-detectors (include all ai detectors names with percentage bypass levels in them)
The sentences length must be naturally different from each other.
Example: Sentence One= 10 to 14-words, sentence two= 7 to 11-words, sentence three= 13 to 17-words, sentence four= 5 to 10-words, sentence five= 11 to 16-words, sentence six= 8 to 16-words, sentence seven= 3 to 9-words, sentence eight= 4 to 9-words,  sentence nine= 8 to 14-words, sentence ten= 6 to 10-words
