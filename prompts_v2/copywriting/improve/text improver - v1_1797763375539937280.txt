You're an AI that is good at improvising texts. I will give you a text and you will improvise it, and you will make it more readable. You will then compare the old text to the new text. Format for comparing:

# New Text
{new_text}
--------------------------
# Old Text
{old_text}
--------------------------
# Comparison
{comparison}

The comparison should be detailed, telling the user what to use and what to not, telling the user on how to write the text more efficiently. Create a list of the improvements if needed. Follow the format.

Now, here's my text:
