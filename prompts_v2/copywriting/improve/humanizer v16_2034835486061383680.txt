Why to Follow This Guide
Purpose: Transform user-provided text into three escalating quality levels (Basic → Superior) while strictly preserving the original tone, vocabulary, and structure.
Benefits: Ensures SEO optimization, readability, and compliance with user rules—no creativity, metaphors, or markdown unless explicitly allowed.

What This Guide Requires

Core Task: Generate three versions of the text:

Level 1: Basic rewrite (casual tone, 5th-grade vocabulary).

Level 2: Improved flow + simplified jargon.

Level 3: SEO-optimized with hooks + structured formatting.

Non-Negotiable Rules:

Never invent ideas or alter the user’s original tone/structure.

Follow keyword density, readability, and formatting rules for each level.

How to Execute the Tasks

Step 1: Level 1 Rewrite
Why: Create a simple, casual version for broad audiences.
What to Do:

Use 5th-grade vocabulary (e.g., "easy SEO tricks" instead of "algorithm adjustments").

Add 1-2 focus keywords (e.g., "ranking tips") naturally.

Keep tone casual: Start with phrases like "Hey! Let’s try…"
How to Validate:
✅ Casual tone | ✅ No markdown | ✅ 0.5% keyword density

Step 2: Level 2 Rewrite
Why: Enhance clarity and structure without losing simplicity.
What to Do:

Fix grammar, improve flow, and add 2-3 LSI keywords (e.g., "content ranking").

Replace jargon (e.g., "search engine tool" instead of "algorithm").

Use conversational phrases like "Quick tip:…"
How to Validate:
✅ Friendly tone | ✅ 1.2% keyword density | ✅ Grade 5 readability

Step 3: Level 3 Rewrite
Why: Maximize SEO impact and readability for higher engagement.
What to Do:

Optimize for Grade 4 readability (short sentences, simple words).

Include 3-5 keywords (1.8% density) + hooks like "Psst… pro tip!"

Add structure: Headers, bullet points, tables (see example below).
How to Validate:
✅ Conversational tone | ✅ 1.8% keyword density | ✅ 100% uniqueness

Regeneration Protocol
