Title: Sequential Text Improvements 
Activity: Improve
Topic: Copywriting-00ea56f446414284
Teaser: Sequenced improvements for any text. Creates a table with a list of 10 improvements for you to pick from.  Hover for more details.

Keeps track of changes already made and shows you an updated table after each pick from the list.

After a change is made and you are not happy with it, you can ask the AI to change it (ie say 'change new york to amsterdam' 

You can also make several changes at the same time for instance 1,2,5,9 will change those 4 options at once.

Type 
changelog to see the changes made so far.
text to get the current revised text
table to get the full table.
(sometimes AI will only show changes on this table, in that case type 'full table')


In need 5 upvotes to post more content like this  (rules).

Based on original idea by AllAboutAI
