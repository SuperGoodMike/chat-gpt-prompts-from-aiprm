Teaser: How do initial coin offerings (ICOs) work?
When a company decides to have an ICO, it announces the date, rules, and buying process in advance. On the date of the ICO, investors can buy the new cryptocurrency.

Most ICOs require investors to pay using another cryptocurrency, with Bitcoin (BTC 0.97%) and Ethereum (ETH 0.31%) being two common choices. There are also ICOs that accept fiat money.

The purchase process typically involves sending money to a specified crypto wallet address. Investors provide their own recipient address to receive the crypto they buy.

The number of tokens sold during an ICO and the token price can be either fixed or variable. Here are examples of the ways this can work:

Fixed number of tokens and price: The company sets both of these ahead of time, such as offering one million tokens at a price of $1 per token.
Fixed number of tokens and a variable price: The company sells a fixed number of tokens and prices them based on the amount of funds it receives. More funding results in a higher token price. If it's selling one million tokens and raises $2 million, each token would have a price of $2.
Variable number of tokens and a fixed price: The company sets a fixed price but doesn't limit the number of tokens it will sell. An example would be if a company sells tokens at $0.50 apiece until the ICO ends.
Anyone can launch an ICO. Because of the low barrier to entry, many new types of cryptocurrency are launched through this process.

How to start your own ICO
At the most basic level, starting your own ICO is a matter of creating a cryptocurrency token, setting a date, and making rules for the token sale.

To successfully raise funds, there's much more that goes into the ICO process. The most important part is having a cryptocurrency project that people are interested in supporting. You also need to determine how the cryptocurrency you launch will fit into the project. And, during the ICO process, you'll need all of the following:

A whitepaper outlining your project
A roadmap with short- and long-term goals
Market research on other ICOs
A website
Social media presence
A marketing campaign
With all that goes into an ICO, it takes a dedicated team to be successful. You can create a team yourself or work with an ICO company that specializes in these offerings.
