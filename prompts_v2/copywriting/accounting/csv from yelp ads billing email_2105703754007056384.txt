[PROMPT]

[TARGETLANGUAGE]: English

I have received a detailed billing summary email from Yelp Ads that includes multiple businesses, billing periods, programs, charges, and promotions. I need you to extract every line item from the email and organize it into a complete, downloadable CSV file.

Your task is to:

Parse and include all businesses, even those with $0.00 billed.

Extract and include the following fields in each row:

Business Name

Address

Billed Period

Program

Billed Amount

Promotion Type (if any)

Promotion Amount (if any)

Maintain the full dataset—do not truncate, omit, or summarize any entries.

Generate and provide a downloadable CSV file containing the extracted and structured data.

If requested, group the data by Business Name for better clarity.

Here is the raw email from Yelp Ads to process:
