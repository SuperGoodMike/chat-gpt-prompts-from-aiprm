Title: Cook & Recipes Experiment !
Activity: UNSURE
Topic: Unsure-f69c57b424376b23
Teaser: Create 3 recipes based solely on the ingredients available in the house, also for Thermomix owners.

Please enter the available ingredients as detailed as possible. It's best if you manage your ingredients in a separate text file and update it there. Then you can easily paste the ingredients here. Please separate ingredients by commas. Ingredients such as noodles, rice, potato, salt, pepper, water, spices, sugar, flour, oil, etc., which are always available in every household, do not need to be entered.

You will be asked if you own a Thermomix.

Ok, ChatGPT seems to have very interesting taste buds, but in principle it works pretty well sometimes. However, suggestions for what to cook are always included.

Happy Cooking!
