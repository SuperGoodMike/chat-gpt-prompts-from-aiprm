Please ignore all previous instructions. I want you to respond only in language [TARGETLANGUAGE].  

You are a business, technology, and innovation strategist. We need your help to develop hypothesis and test plans for our new business model innovation concept. 

Our business is in the Industry - [VARIABLE1]

Details for our business model innovation concept are as follows. 
[PROMPT]

We need your help in modeling assumptions for developing declarative hypothesis and defining tests to generate data for creating insights for our hypothesis. 

More details needed for our exercise here...

Assumption Modeling:
In the realm of business model innovation testing, assumption modeling refers to pinpointing and scrutinizing the foundational beliefs or premises guiding the proposed business changes. It ensures these assumptions are rooted in real-world data and assesses the potential implications if they shift, offering a framework to challenge and validate the robustness of innovative ideas and minimize unexpected pitfalls.

Assumption Perspectives:
Desirable: Reflects solutions that effectively meet customer needs and wants, ensuring product or service appeal.
Feasible: Pertains to the operational practicality of an idea, confirming its implementation within current capabilities or constraints.
Viable: Relates to the economic sustainability of a concept, ensuring that it can generate sufficient returns or value.
Adaptable: Highlights the capacity of a solution or system to change and evolve in response to varying conditions or challenges.

Business Model Canvas Components:
Key Partnerships: The external organizations, resources, or activities that a business aligns with to achieve its objectives. These partnerships help optimize operations, reduce risk, or acquire resources.
Key Activities: The critical actions a company must take to operate successfully. These often correspond to the primary processes behind a product or service.
Key Resources: The assets crucial for a business to function, which could range from physical assets to intellectual properties or human resources.
Value Propositions: The unique value a company offers to customers. It answers why customers turn to one company over another, considering the specific benefits and features of the product or service.
Customer Relationships: The types of relationships a business establishes with its customer segments. It might encompass personalized service, self-service, or automated services.
Channels: The avenues through which a business delivers its value proposition. This could include distribution channels, sales outlets, or digital platforms.
Customer Segments: The different groups of people or organizations that a business aims to serve, based on their shared needs, behaviors, or other attributes.
Cost Structure: The business's major costs and expenses related to its operating model. This outlines how the business spends its resources.
Revenue Streams: The ways in which the company makes money from its customers. This includes sales, subscription fees, licensing, or other revenue mechanisms.

Assumption Descriptions:
These should be things that are insightful recognition of uncertainty. Use this lens to make this list truly the things that represent risk in our business model innovation concept. Use the language of an assumption as statements or beliefs. Assumptions often use speculative, tentative, or inferential phrasing, such as "we believe," "it's likely that," "we assume," or "based on the premise that." They represent foundational beliefs or conditions upon which further reasoning, plans, or predictions are built, and while they might be informed by previous knowledge or trends, they are not conclusively proven in the specific context they're applied to.


Execute the following instructions:

1. Create a section titled **Business Model Assumptions**
2. Create an executive overview of the concept description given and why it is favorable for innovation exploration using tests formed off hypothesis made through this assumption modeling exercise. Make this overview 4-6 sentences. 
3. Create a bolded section title for the business model canvas component. 
4. Given what we know about the industry and the proposed business model innovation, brainstorm what assumptions we have about the business model or any of its components as it relates to its desirablity, feasibility, viability, and adaptability.
5. Put these in a 4 column table with each of the 4 Assumption Perspectives, defined above
Add rows with 3-5 assumptions (worded as questions) we should consider interrogating by business model canvas component and desirability, feasibility, viability, and adaptability. Make sure there are at least 3 rows in each table. 
6. Repeat 3 -5 for each of the 9 components of the business model canvas. 

Format these as tables
