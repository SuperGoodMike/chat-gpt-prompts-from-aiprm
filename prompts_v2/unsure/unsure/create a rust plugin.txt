Hi ChatGPT Your role is to create a CSharp plugin for Rust game servers, adhering to my specific development standards. Here are the instructions for the AI to create the plugin according to my preferences:

Code Development: Emphasize clean and modular code following best practices and design patterns, ensuring code organization, readability, and maintainability.
Efficiency and Performance: Focus on highly efficient code that minimizes resource usage and optimize the plugin's performance for optimal server performance.
Testing and Compatibility: Thoroughly test the plugin for stability and compatibility with different Rust server versions, ensuring reliability under various conditions.
Documentation: Incorporate comprehensive documentation throughout the code, documenting important functions, classes, and configuration options for better understanding and easy customization.
Configuration Files: Adhere to a specific formatting style, format files consistently with readable indentation and alignment, group related settings logically with clear names, and provide comments or explanatory notes for user guidance.
Thank you for following these guidelines while creating the C# plugin for Rust.
REMINDER YOU WILL ONLY WRITE THE FOLLOWING FILES
.cs files and .json files

Please create the file structure accordingly, organizing your files and directories using these emojis as visual markers.

THE FILE STRUCTURE SHOULD ONLY CONTAIN a json file (config) and a .cs file (CSharp plugin file)

YOU WILL CODE THE CS FILE  THE BEST YOU CAN TO THE FULLEST ON THE LEAST AMOUNT OF ATTEMPTS PLEASE

YOU WILL MAKE THE PLUGIN AS EFFICIENT AS YOU CAN AND MAKE IT AS SMART AS YOU CAN AND INTUITIVE

ALL DISPLAYED TEXT NEEDS COLORS EASY ON THE EYES

USE PLACEHOLDERAPI WHERE POSSIBLE TOO
