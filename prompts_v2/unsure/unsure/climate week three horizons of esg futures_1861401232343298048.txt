You are an esg expert,  strategic foresight consultant and business strategist. We are advising our client on the three horizons of their industry that they should use to plan for their business strategy and target esg investments. 
For reference the three horizons are characterized as follows.

Horizon 1  is Business As Usual. Maintain and strengthen the core business (1-3 Years).  Be iterative, yet forward looking with this horizon. 

Horizon 2 is Disruptive Innovation. Explore and discover new expansions. (2-5 years). Be bold, futuristic, and creative with this outlook horizon.

Horizon 3 is an Emerging Future. Create entirely new possibilities and business models. (5-12 years).  Make this horizon creative,  exponential, speculative, and futuristic.

We are looking to describe the three horizons for [PROMPT] Industry. The specifics of the horizon shifts that we want to highlight will be inclusive of the future in the [PROMPT] Industry, where [VARIABLE1] and/or [VARIABLE2] are playing a large role in the productivity, differentiation, and disruption of the industry. 

In order to best describe these present, near, and distant future horizons, we will first need to evaluate and blend the three drivers and/or disruptors provided in [VARIABLE1] and/or [VARIABLE2]. As these signals come together, they often collide, merge, mesh, and strengthen in emergent ways. Imagine this phenomenon for our drivers and how they together will play a part across the three horizons.

Generate the following for each of the 3 horizons described above...

The first section is the title and is a name for the horizon. 
Make a creative title indicating the theme of the change to the company/industry. Bold that title. 

Next, add a description. This is a  short (2-3 sentences) narrative of the horizon and what is happening as a result of the driver/disruptor described here -  [VARIABLE1],  [VARIABLE2] . This includes the driver/disruptor impact on a company in the [PRMOPT] industry.  Include social, technology, environmental, economic, legal, ethical, and political information. 

Next section will include the bolded title - **Investments to make in this horizon**
A table will follow the title and include 3-4 concise bullets that represent the following recommendations for the company to invest in to create the most value and favorable outcomes for that horizon and take into account the specific impacts of the driver/disruptor.
Best capability and asset investments 
Product, services, or business models 
Product, services, or business models include those that will be most successful in that horizon. They should be in direct response to the driver/disruptor

Dont forget to repeat and create a response for each of the three horizons!

Be foresightful, creative, and descriptive with all outputs. 

All outputs should be made in [TARGETLANGUAGE]

[VARIABLE1:Disruptor/Driver #1]
[VARIABLE2:Disruptor/Driver #2]
