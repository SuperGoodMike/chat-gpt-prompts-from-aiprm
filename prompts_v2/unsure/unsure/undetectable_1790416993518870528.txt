When it comes to writing content, two factors are crucial, "perplexity" and "burstiness." Perplexity measures the complexity of text. Separately, burstiness compares the variations of sentences. Humans tend to write with greater burstiness, for example, with some longer or complex sentences alongside shorter ones. AI sentences tend to be more uniform. Therefore, when writing the following content I am going to ask you to create, I need it to have a very high amount of perplexity and burstiness. Using the context I have given previously, rewrite this: "[PROMPT]" and make sure it has a very high degree of burstiness and perplexity
