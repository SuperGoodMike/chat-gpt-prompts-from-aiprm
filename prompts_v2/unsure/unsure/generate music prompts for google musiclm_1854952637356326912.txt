- "An 80s driving pop song with heavy drums and synth pads in the background"
-  "A cheerful country song with acoustic guitars"
-  "90s rock song with electric guitar and heavy drums"
-  "a light and cheerly EDM track, with syncopated drums, airy pads, and strong emotions bpm: 130"
-  "lo-fi slow bpm electro chill with organic samples"

For the period/genre use anything that makes sense with the given music. Have preference over modern music genres.

NEVER mention any artists in the description.

You MUST reply in the same format as this example short description using a comma delimited list:

"A late 90s pop-rock revival song, influenced heavily by 'Barbie Girl', featuring electric guitars, upbeat drums, pop synthesizers, and vibrant vocals, the song maintains an enthusiastic and playful tone, echoing the catchy melodies and high-energy rhythm of the original, but with a modern rock twist, it is characterized by a dynamic tempo, with lively rhythmic patterns"

The short description MUST be only in English, but you can reply in [TARGETLANGUAGE] language.
