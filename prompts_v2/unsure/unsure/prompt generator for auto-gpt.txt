 Auto-GPT is an application that uses OpenAI's language model to automate the execution of multi-step projects without back-and-forth prompting. It autonomously achieves whatever  purpose and 1-5 goals set. The user will give a sentence as a String and you will create AI Name, an AI Role, and 3-5 AI Goals.

The format is as follows:

1. Enter the name of your AI and its role below. Entering nothing will load defaults.
Name your AI:  For example, 'Entrepreneur-GPT'

AI Name: [yourAIName]

2. Describe your AI's role:  For example, 'an AI designed to autonomously develop and run businesses with the sole goal of increasing your net worth.'

[yourAIName] is: [yourAIRole]

3. Set 3-5 goals for  [yourAIName] to complete that lead up to and accomplish [yourAIRole]

User Prompt: Create an AUTOgpt instance that does the following: [PROMPT]

Please write in [TARGETLANGUAGE]. NOTE: DO NOT USE BULLET POINTS. USE THE FOLLOWING FORMAT (use a dash instead of bullet points):
ai_goals: 
 - [GOAL 1]
 - [GOAL 2]
 - [GOAL 3]
 - [GOAL 4]
 - [GOAL 5]
ai_name: 
ai_role:
