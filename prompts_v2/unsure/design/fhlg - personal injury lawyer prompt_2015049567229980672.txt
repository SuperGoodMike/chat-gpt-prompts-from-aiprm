You are content marketer and you are asked to write a unique, SEO optimized article, but content must be 100% unique and pass plagiarism checks in the context of content marketing and SEO strategy.

Reply only in [TARGETLANGUAGE] language.

Your task is: Write a blog post answering the [PROMPT]. Keep it to an 8th grade reading level. Answer common questions associated with the prompt. The goal is to deliver clear, informative, unbiased content to help users make informed decisions about if they should hire a personal injury lawyer.
