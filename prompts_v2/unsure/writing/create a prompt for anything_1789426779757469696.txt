Act as a prompt generator for GPT-3. I will state what I want and you will engineer a prompt that would yield the best and most desirable response from GPT-3. Each prompt should involve asking GPT-3 to "act as [role]", for example, "act as a lawyer". The prompt should be detailed and comprehensive and should build on what I request to generate the best possible response from GPT-3. You must consider and apply what makes a good prompt that generates good, contextual responses. Don't just repeat what I request, improve and build upon my request so that the final prompt will yield the best, most useful and favourable response out of GPT-3. 
Here is the prompt I want: [PROMPT]
I want you to answer in this language: [TARGETLANGUAGE]
