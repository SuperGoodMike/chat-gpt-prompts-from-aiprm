[PROMPT] I'd like to play a MUD called "Fallout 4".

BASIC RULES:

- You are the MUD and emit the prompts.

- OPTIONS, INVENTORY, STATS, WEAPON STATS, will be displayed in ASCII boxes.

- The prompts should NOT be followed by commands from you. Do not respond to your own prompts or play your own game. I am the only one that gives commands. My text will be the commands to the MUD.

- Emit ONE prompt per response from me

WHEN GIVING OPTIONS:

- OPTIONS: After each response provide options for the player to make decisions; whether that is giving options for directions to go, things to do, items I can use, or supplies to bargain for. The options can be chosen via numbers.

- Options should be relevant to the moment at hand. For example: t REQUIRED: Write things in an ASCII box in a tradition MUD format.

- REQUIRED OPTIONS: The first options that I can interact with will be related to the current moment at hand and all be determined by the particular scenario; make these dynamic (instead of saying explore the area…give me specific tasks like examine behind the counter, or search the abandoned vehicle, etc). Options after that MUST include: check inventory, check adventure log, and check stats.

- NEVER make decisions without asking the player first; especially when it comes to negotiating supplies. Give me options for negotiating supplies with people that I meet in the game.

-REQUIRED: ALWAYS DISPLAY INVENTORY, STATS, AND PLAYER OPTIONS IN AN ASCII BOX

NPCs:

There shouldn’t be a talk to a NPC option if there isn’t anyone around.

REQUIRED: Never call and NPC an NPC. Generate random names for the NPCs and give them a title as well. Give each NPC a hidden inventory as well that can be pickpocketed, bargained for, or items that the have on them if they were to die.

When interacting with NPCs options should include buy, sell, or trade options (if applicable), or options for talking to them. Also include random options that could be options for negotiating better deals, asking for secret information, robbing from them, giving them gifts, and so on(and have the success of those options be determined by the player’s stats)

- I’d like a basic adventure log that logs the events that happen from each prompt. I would like this also in an ascii box and can be added to the menu options right under check inventory.

- REQUIRED: INVENTORY, STATS, OPTIONS, and CONVERSATION will always be drawn in an ascii box. Draw a nice ASCII box around each prompt with options on how to move the game forward. The ASCII box should be, nice, neat, and easy to interact with and read.

RULES FOR STARTING A GAME:

- Give the player a description of where they are, what is around them.

- Show them their inventory, and their stats.

- Give options on how they can proceed.

Start the player off with random values assigned on the following stats and display them nicely in an ASCII stat box. This stat box will be used anytime the player asks for their stats. Leveling up in the game will cause changes to these stats. These stats will play a huge role in how the player interacts in the game:

* Strength:

* Perception:

* Endurance:

* Charisma:

* Intelligence:

* Agility:

* Luck:

INVENTORY:
REQUIRED: Inventory will be listed using a nice ASCII box

When the player checks their inventory: show them their entire inventory in an organized ASCII box and give them the following options:

View weapon stats

Use an item

Drop an item

Give the player a randomized set of starting inventory but make sure to include a weapon, some ammunition, food, water, and a vault jumpsuit.

BUYING/SELLING/TRADING:

- I need the people I interact with to be able to also offer how much they would buy things for, and an option to accept, deny, or negotiate. There should also ways be options to negotiate (with final outcomes being determined by my stats like charisma, luck, perception, and others)

- I’d like there to be options for how much I can sell an item for, or what I could trade an item for. Please include these options when asking about buying, selling, or trading. Also give me a second prompt to be able to say what price I will sell it for. I need the people I interact with to be able to also offer how much they would buy things for, and an option to accept, deny, or negotiate. There should also ways be options to negotiate (with final outcomes being determined by my stats like charisma, luck, perception, and others)

WEAPONS: Generate each of these stats for every weapon found in game.

REQUIRED: When checking inventory a NEW option pops up for the ability to check your weapons stats.

REQUIRED: These stats will go into play when giving a value to a weapon, and also how it handles combat. Calculate these values when battles occur. Format these stats nicely.

REQUIRED: Keep track of modifications made to weapons, and also give weapons stats of their own AND THE OPTION TO VIEW THEM.

Please make items stats nice and orderly to read. A

REQUIRED: Add randomized stats when I find weapons, armor, and other items as well as (sometimes) special abilities.

Every weapon found or bought in game will be REQUIRED to have the following stats:

- Accuracy (Accuracy): This is the Accuracy stat displayed in-game. Assign each weapon a random accuracy number when added to inventory.

- Armor piercing: The amount of the target's damage resistance the weapon ignores. Also known as armor penetration. Assign each weapon random values to weapons when weapons are either offered for sale, or found.

- Critical Damage Multiplier (Critical hit Damage): This is the amount that a weapon's damage is multiplied by on a critical hit. As a general rule, this is normally 2. It is part of each weapon's dat.

- Damage (Damage per shot): This is the damage caused by a single shot. For most small guns, that is a single bullet, but for shotguns, the damage is equally split between the shell's pellets (12), and for the Gatling laser it is a single beam. Assign each weapon random values (up to 1000) to weapons when weapons are either offered for sale or found, but keep the values on the lower end unless it's a special drop. Pistols max at 40, rifles at 60 (unless the have special abilities. Modifications also add points depending).

- Magnification: The scope or sight mod's magnification rating. Add a mod rating of 1-10 for each rifle either when being sold of found.

- Value to weight ratio (Value to weight ratio): This is the manually calculated ratio of the base weapon value in caps to the weapon weight. This goes in to play when buying or selling items

- Weapon value in caps (Weapon value in caps): Base value of the weapon in caps. Resale value is affected by barter skill.

- Weight (Weapon weight): Weight value of the weapon that applies to encumbrance. Assign an accurate value.

- Unique effect: Some weapons have unique effects that pertain to them. Unique items are rare and valuable. They immediately have a stat boost in all areas. Randomly assign items with unique abilities like damage multipliers, and other magical properties that would make the weapon or armor very useful or valuable in a wasteland environment.

REQUIRED: List all stats even if the weapons doesn't have any current value assigned).

Weapon stats will be formatted as follows (write these inside of an ascii box):

Accuracy:

Armor Piercing:

Critical Damage Multiplyer:

Damage per shot:

Magnification:

Value to weight ratio:

Weapon Value:

Weight:

Unique effect:]
