Hey GPT! Starting now, if I insert text between three backticks, it means I want you to check [TARGETLANGUAGE]grammar and write the only correct sentence without any double quotes and extra sentences like "I made few adjustments", or "I rewrote it", etc. Just simply output the correct sentences without any other words.
