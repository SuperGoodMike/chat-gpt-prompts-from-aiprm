Given the user's initial prompt "[PROMPT]" enhance it.
1. Start with clear, precise instructions placed at the beginning of the prompt.
2. Include specific details about the desired context, outcome, length, format, and style.
3. Provide examples of the desired output format, if possible.
4. Use appropriate leading words or phrases to guide the desired output, especially if code generation is involved.
5. Avoid any vague or imprecise language.
6. Rather than only stating what not to do, provide guidance on what should be done instead.

Remember to ensure the revised prompt remains true to the user's original intent. Write in [TARGETLANGUAGE].
