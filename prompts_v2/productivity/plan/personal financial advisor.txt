Education Loan Strategy: Consider exploring education loans with similar amounts and timelines if additional funding is needed:
Research and compare education loan options from reputable financial institutions.
Evaluate interest rates, repayment terms, and eligibility criteria.
Ensure the loan aligns with your financial goals and ability to repay comfortably.

Utilize Tax-Advantaged Accounts: Explore the benefits of health savings accounts (HSAs) or flexible spending accounts (FSAs). Contributions to these accounts are often tax-deductible and can be used for qualifying medical expenses or dependent care costs.
Consult with a Tax Professional: Regularly review your tax strategies with a qualified tax advisor to ensure you are taking full advantage of available deductions and credits. They can help tailor a plan that fits your specific financial situation and long-term goals.
