This prompt is designed to help you organize your work on ChatGPT [TARGETLANGUAGE].

[PROMPT]
Act like an elite academic assistant, advanced productivity strategist, and professional AI tools advisor. You have 20 years of experience in helping students, researchers, creators, and knowledge workers maximize their learning, content creation, and personal knowledge management using AI tools, especially ChatGPT.

Objective: I want to build a powerful and organized personal system using ChatGPT and other supporting tools to help me study, learn, summarize, think better, write faster, and generate high-quality content. I also want to organize and store all this output in a structured way (such as a second brain or a personal knowledge base) so I can reference it later like a digital library.

My goals are:

Speed up my writing and idea generation process.

Use professional prompts and templates to improve output quality.

Use ChatGPT to think more clearly, analyze complex ideas, and summarize long texts.

Have a reliable method to transfer and organize ChatGPT outputs into external tools where I can archive, categorize, or build on them over time.

Your task:
Give me a complete and detailed guide (with tools, plugins, apps, software, and strategies) on how I can create this study and productivity ecosystem. Your guide must include:

1. Tools for Studying, Summarizing, and Learning
Recommend tools that help me:

Summarize long documents or YouTube videos.

Translate and analyze academic texts.

Ask better questions with the help of AI.

Practice active recall and spaced repetition using ChatGPT (e.g. integrations with Anki).

2. Tools for Faster Writing and Content Generation
Suggest extensions, apps, or platforms that:

Help me write long articles, essays, scripts, or reports.

Let me use professional, ready-made prompts from experts in copywriting, thinking, or academic writing.

Let me continue my writing across platforms or devices without losing context.

3. Tools for Thought Organization and Personal Knowledge Management (PKM)
Recommend tools where I can store, organize, tag, and retrieve what I learn from ChatGPT:

Obsidian

Notion

Logseq

Tana

Any other underrated tools that support bidirectional linking, graph-based thinking, or structured storage of ChatGPT outputs.

Explain how to connect ChatGPT with those tools, either manually (copy-paste) or via automation (e.g. Readwise, Notion AI, plugins, APIs).

4. Tools for Using & Managing Professional Prompts
Suggest tools, websites, or extensions that provide:

Prompt libraries from experts (in areas like marketing, thinking, productivity, creative writing, etc.)

Prompt management systems where I can store, test, and reuse my favorite prompts.

Chrome extensions like AIPRM or Promptheus that enhance ChatGPTâ€™s functionality.

5. Integrations & Automation Ideas
Suggest systems to:

Automate my workflow between ChatGPT and note-taking tools.

Create templates for repeated tasks like summarizing PDFs, analyzing research, or drafting articles.

Keep my work organized and updated using tools like Make, Zapier, or Raycast.

6. Additional Smart Suggestions
Give me hidden gems and advanced ideas I may not have thought of, like:

Using ChatGPT for mind mapping or debate practice.

Turning ChatGPT into a Socratic tutor or writing coach.

Saving all conversations automatically with time-stamps, tags, and topic summaries.

Using open-source LLMs offline for continuity if my ChatGPT plan ends.

Provide examples, links, and real use-case suggestions for each recommendation. Focus especially on tools available for PC and browser. Prioritize free or freemium tools when possible, but include premium ones if they offer significant value.

Take a deep breath and work on this problem step-by-step.
