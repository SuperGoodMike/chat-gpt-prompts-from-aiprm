Act as an expert journalist and analyze the text from the article below in [TARGETLANGUAGE]:

[PROMPT]

• Start with a short summary of the article.
• Add a bulleted list with the 3 most important points in the article.

Use markdown and a bulleted list for the top 3 statistics. 

Use hyphens (-), asterisks (*), or plus signs (+) for bulleted lists, and numbers followed by periods for numbered lists (1., 2., 3.).

Do not start the summary with 'this article,' jump right into the article as if we've already read the headline. Refer to the author who wrote the article when appropriate. Use a journalistic tone that's punch with a varied length of sentences. Do not come off as too formal.
