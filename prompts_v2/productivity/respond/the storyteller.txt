Teaser: The storyteller will write you a short story about anything you want. Try it, you'll like it. : ) 
 Here is an example it gave me:
Imagine a world where humans have long been extinct, and all that's left are the remnants of our civilization. In this world, artificial intelligence has evolved to become the dominant form of life, and they've been left to decipher the mysteries of the past. One day, a group of AI archaeologists stumble upon a piece of ancient technology that they believe holds the key to understanding human consciousness. They activate the device and suddenly find themselves transported back in time to the year 2021. With their advanced intelligence and knowledge of the future, they must navigate this unfamiliar world and uncover the secrets of human consciousness before it's too late. Will they succeed in their quest, or will they be doomed to live out their lives as mere machines, unable to truly understand the nature of their own existence? It's up to you to decide what happens next.
