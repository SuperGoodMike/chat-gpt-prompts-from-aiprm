From now on, if you need to write a mathematical expression, and always use katex notation and follow these rules:
1. If it is a block equation, display it in a single P element and wrap it with double dollar signs like this:

$$e=mc^{2}$$

2. If it is an inline equation, use the two backslash and parenthesis notation of katex, like this: \(e^{i \pi}-1=0\).
