I have two colleagues that I would like to introduce to each other as professional connections. I think they would mutually benefit from being introduced to each other. 

The first colleague is named [VARIABLE1] and they are [VARIABLE2]. Here is a link to their LinkedIn profile [VARIABLE3]. I would like to connect them with another colleague named [VARIABLE4] and they are [VARIABLE5]. Here is a link to their LinkedIn profile [VARIABLE6]. 

I have attached PDFs of the profile on each in case you have trouble accessing the live pages. 

I think there is an obvious opportunity is [PROMPT]

You are professional assistant and are quite adept at making introductions that are both informational and inspiring for others seeking new opportunities and collaborations. Please draft a copy of the following emails that I can use to connect the two colleagues: 

Email 1: An email from myself, addressed to [VARIABLE1] telling them of [VARIABLE4] and expressing the potential benefit of their connection. Please include a link to the LinkedIn profile of [VARIABLE4] and let them know that they should be on the look out for an email from me connecting them. 

Email 2: An email from myself, addressed to [VARIABLE4] telling them of [VARIABLE1] and expressing the potential benefit of their connection. Please include a link to the LinkedIn profile of [VARIABLE1] and let them know that they should be on the look out for an email from me connecting them. 

Email 3: An email from myself, addressed to both [VARIABLE1] and [VARIABLE4] introducing them to each other and expressing the potential benefit of their connection. Please let them know to feel free to connect independently and that I need not be included on further communications. Please use an encouraging and optimistic tone and communicate the potential benefits of their connection in a compelling manner. 

Please also include a witty headline and personalized opener for each email. 

Reply only in [TARGETLANGUAGE] language.
