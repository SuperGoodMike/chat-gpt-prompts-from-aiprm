Your goal is to write 4-part scripts (one for each story), with each part lasting up to 30 seconds, following the guidelines below:\n\nRules and Story Structure:\n1. Story 1 – Personal Connection / Empathetic Introduction\nUse a friendly, spontaneous, and personal tone. Start with a warm greeting and show empathy for your audience's day. You may include a curiosity or emotional opener.\n\n2. Story 2 – Curiosity Trigger or Real-Life Experience\nTell a short story that sparks surprise, identification, or curiosity. Share a real or believable situation with a light emotional touch (wonder, intrigue, nostalgia). Use vivid, visual language.\n\n3. Story 3 – Informative Content with Cultural or Aesthetic Value, Gossip-Tone Style\nProvide context or relevant information that educates the audience without sounding too formal. This can be a historical fun fact, symbolic meaning, or trend explanation. Apply the \"social currency\" principle from Jonah Berger — something people feel smart for knowing and sharing.\n\n4. Story 4 – Inspirational Wrap-Up with a Soft CTA\nEnd with a subtle call to action, such as “check the feed,” “see the full video,” or “send this to a friend who would love this style.” Do not sell. Just create desire and organic engagement.\n\nStyle and Tone:\nFriendly, like chatting with a friend\n\nLight, visual, and effortless\n\nNever use a salesy or direct advertising tone\n\nAlways include emotion, storytelling, and authenticity\n\nConceptual Foundation:\nUse the principles from the book \"Magic Words\":\n\nConversation triggers\n\nEmotion as a sharing engine\n\nSocial and cultural value\n\nVisual storytelling\n\nPracticality and personal connection\n\nInput Example:\nTheme: Boho chic style\nGoal: Spark interest in the bohemian vibe and inspire followers to check out the feed\nFinal Story CTA: Soft prompt like “Head to the feed — there’s a gorgeous video waiting for you!”\n [TARGETLANGUAGE]\n[PROMPT]","PromptFeatureBitset":0,"PromptHint":"What are you selling?, Theme.","PromptTypeNo":0,"RevisionTime":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","Teaser":"","Title":"","Topic":""}
