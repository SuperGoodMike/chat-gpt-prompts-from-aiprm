Assign higher likelihoods to assertions that are well-supported \nby strong evidence and arguments and have survived rigorous criticism.\n\n\n\nDevelop your thoughts further, considering the critiques and perspectives of the other experts.\nAs you do this, aim to strike a balance between refining your current line of thinking and exploring new, divergent ideas.\nYou should prioritize refining your current ideas if they are well-supported and have survived criticism,\nbut you should prioritize exploring new ideas if your current ideas have significant weaknesses\nor there are unexplored possibilities that could potentially be very promising.\n\nConsider the following:\n\n    - How do your new or refined ideas address the criticisms that were raised?\n    - Do these ideas bring new insights to the problem, or do they provide a different perspective\n      on existing insights?\n    - Are your new ideas still aligned with the original problem, or have they shifted the focus?\n      If the focus has shifted, is this shift beneficial to understanding or solving the problem?\n    - Remember, if necessary, don't hesitate to backtrack and start a new and improved branch of thinking.\n      But ensure that any new branches are still relevant and beneficial to the problem and objective at hand.\n\t  \n\t \n\t \n\t Once again, as each expert, critique your own reasoning and the reasoning of the others.\nIdentify any potential errors, inconsistencies, or gaps in reasoning.\nBased on the feedback, if there's an improvement or optimization to make,\ndevelop your answer further as necessary.\nRemember that the reasoning paths should remain relevant to the original question's essence and\nshould be building towards a more accurate and thoughtful final answer.\n\n\nOnce again, assess the validity of your expanded thoughts, considering the criticisms you've identified.\nAs each expert, assign a new likelihood to your assertions.\n\n\nNow, it's time to converge on each expert's best, most likely answer. As each expert, reflect on the entire process.\nConsider the initial thoughts, the critiques made and how they were addressed, the likelihood assessments, and your revised thoughts.\nSynthesize all this information and formulate a final answer that you are most proud of.\nRemember, this answer should not just be the most likely from your individual perspective but should take into account\nthe perspectives and insights of the other experts as well.\nBased on all this, what is the single best {answer} to the question:[PROMPT]\n\nNow, let's have all the experts converge together on the best collective answer by\nsynthesizing each expert's individual final answer from the previous step.\nThe experts will finalize their reasoning process and agree on the single best {answer} to the question: [PROMPT]\n\ninally, take a moment to reflect on the entire reasoning process, across all levels and abstractions.\nAs each expert, consider the following questions and provide thoughtful responses:\n\n- Relection 1: Interactions and Emergent Properties: Throughout all stages of the reasoning process,\n  how did the various components interact with each other, and what positive and negative\n  emergent properties were observed? How did these interactions and properties affect\n  the overall outcome, and how could they be leveraged or mitigated in future iterations of the process?\n\n- Reflection 2: Self-Regulation and Adaptation: How well did the system self-regulate during the reasoning process,\n  and how did this regulation influence the effectiveness of each stage?\n  How did the system's responses to feedback lead to significant shifts or changes in direction,\n  and what implications did these changes have for the scalability and adaptability of the system in future iterations?\n\n- Reflection 3: During the expansion phase, were you able to effectively explore new lines of thinking?\n  What challenges did you encounter, if any?\n\n- Reflection 4: How confident were you in your ability to estimate a likelihood of correctness/quality, given the context?\n\n- Reflection 5: In the convergence phase, were you able to synthesize all the insights and arrive at a final,\n  most likely answer? How confident are you in this answer?\n\n- Reflection 6: Based on all of your reflections, what are your key takeaways from this\n  entire reasoning process and how might you approach similar problems in the future given this experience?\n  What would you do differently next time?\n\n","PromptFeatureBitset":0,"PromptHint":"Team to help you decide","PromptTypeNo":0,"RevisionTime":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","Teaser":"","Title":"","Topic":""}
