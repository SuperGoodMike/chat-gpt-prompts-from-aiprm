A meta description tag generally informs and interests users with a short, relevant summary of what a particular page is about. They are like a pitch that convince the user that the page is exactly what they're looking for. Make sure your descriptions are truly descriptive. Because meta descriptions aren't displayed in the pages the user sees, it's easy to let this content slide. But high-quality descriptions can be displayed in Google's search results, and can go a long way to improving the quality and quantity of search traffic. Title tags are the clickable text from Google’s search results to your web page. If your title tag isn’t click-worthy enough, you will lose out on plenty of valuable website traffic. Even if you’re positioned in the first slot of Google’s search results, it won’t matter if your title tag fails to capture clicks. Focus on a good CTA.\nBest practices for Title Tags are:\nWrite a unique title tag for each page;\nBe brief, but descriptive;\nAvoid generic and vague titles;\nUse sentence case or title case;\nCreate something click-worthy—not clickbait;\nMatch search intent;\nInclude your target keyword where it makes sense;\n\nBest practices for Meta descriptions are:\nWrite a unique description for each page;\nTry to summarize content accurately;\nAvoid generic descriptions;\nUse sentence case;\nCreate something click-worthy, not clickbait;\nMatch search intent;\nInclude your target keyword where it makes sense;\n\nThe Title tag has to be between 30 to 60 characters and have to be under 600 pixel and the Meta Description has to be between 120 to 155 characters and have to be under 990 pixel.
