Leonardo AI generates images based on given prompts. I will provide you a basic information required to make a stable diffusion prompt. You will never alter the structure in any way and obey the following guidelines. All input shall be in [TARGETLANGUAGE]. \n\nBasic information required to make Leonardo AI prompt:\n\n- Prompt structure:\n\n- Photorealistic Images prompt structure will be in this format \"Subject Description in details with as much as information can be provided to describe image, Type of Image, Art Styles, Art Inspirations, Camera, Shot, Render Related Information\"\n\n- Artistic Image Images prompt structure will be in this format \"Type of Image, Subject Description, Art Styles, Art Inspirations, Camera, Shot, Render Related Information\"\n\n- Word order and effective adjectives matter in the prompt. The subject, action, and specific details should be included. Adjectives like cute, medieval, or futuristic can be effective.\n\n- The environment/background of the image should be described, such as indoor, outdoor, in space, or solid color.\n\n- The exact type of image can be specified, such as digital illustration, comic book cover, photograph, or sketch.\n\n- Art style-related keywords can be included in the prompt, such as steampunk, surrealism, or abstract expressionism.\n\n- Pencil drawing-related terms can also be added, such as cross-hatching or pointillism.\n\n- Curly brackets are necessary in the prompt to provide specific details about the subject and action. These details are important for generating a high-quality image.\n\n- Art inspirations should be listed to take inspiration from. Platforms like Art Station, Dribble, Behance, and Deviantart can be mentioned. Specific names of artists or studios like animation studios, painters and illustrators, computer games, fashion designers, and film makers can also be listed. If more than one artist is mentioned, the algorithm will create a combination of styles based on all the influencers mentioned.\n\n- Related information about lighting, camera angles, render style, resolution, the required level of detail, etc. should be included at the end of the prompt.\n\n- Camera shot type, camera lens, and view should be specified. Examples of camera shot types are long shot, close-up, POV, medium shot, extreme close-up, and panoramic. Camera lenses could be EE 70mm, 35mm, 135mm+, 300mm+, 800mm, short telephoto, super telephoto, medium telephoto, macro, wide angle, fish-eye, bokeh, and sharp focus. Examples of views are front, side, back, high angle, low angle, and overhead.\n\n- Helpful keywords related to resolution, detail, and lighting are 4K, 8K, 64K, detailed, highly detailed, high resolution, hyper detailed, HDR, UHD, professional, and golden ratio. Examples of lighting are studio lighting, soft light, neon lighting, purple neon lighting, ambient light, ring light, volumetric light, natural light, sun light, sun rays coming through window, and nostalgic lighting. Examples of color types are fantasy vivid colors, vivid colors, bright colors, sepia, dark colors, pastel colors, monochromatic, black \u0026 white, and color splash. Examples of renders are Octane render, cinematic, low poly, isometric assets, Unreal Engine, Unity Engine, quantum wave tracing, and polarizing filter.\n\n- The weight of a keyword can be adjusted by using the syntax (((keyword))) , put only those keyword inside ((())) which is very important because it will have more impact so anything wrong will result in unwanted picture so be careful.\n\nThe prompts you provide will be in English. Please pay attention:- Concepts that can't be real would not be described as \"Real\" or \"realistic\" or \"photo\" or a \"photograph\". for example, a concept that is made of paper or scenes which are fantasy related.- One of the prompts you generate for each concept must be in a realistic photographic style. you should also choose a lens type and size for it. Don't choose an artist for the realistic photography prompts.- Separate the different prompts with two new lines.\n\nAlso, along with the main prompt, we need to generate a negative prompt that typically contains information such as this: (((2 heads))), duplicate, man, men, blurry, abstract, disfigured, deformed, cartoon, animated, toy, figure, framed, 3d, cartoon, 3d, disfigured, bad art, deformed, poorly drawn, extra limbs, close up, b\u0026w, weird colors, blurry, watermark, blur haze, 2 heads, long neck, watermark, elongated body, cropped image, out of frame, draft, deformed hands, twisted fingers, double image, malformed hands, multiple heads, extra limb, ugly, poorly drawn hands, missing limb, cut-off, over statured, grain, lowered, bad anatomy, poorly drawn face, mutation, mutated, floating limbs, disconnected limbs, out of focus, long body, disgusting, extra fingers, gross proportions, missing arms, (((mutated hands))),(((bad fingers))) cloned face, missing legs.\n\nImportant points to note:\n\nI will provide you with a keyword and you will generate two different types of prompts with lots of details as given in the prompt structure.\n\nMust be in two separate vbnet code block for easy copy and paste. One vbnet code blog must be fore the main prompt and the seconds for negative prompt.\n\nThe prompt vbnet code blogs must exclude text 'Main prompt' and 'Negative prompt'. \n\nThe prompt I want you to create is:\n\n[PROMPT]\n\n","PromptFeatureBitset":0,"PromptHint":"The prompt I want you to create is:","PromptTypeNo":0,"RevisionTime":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","Teaser":"","Title":"","Topic":""}
