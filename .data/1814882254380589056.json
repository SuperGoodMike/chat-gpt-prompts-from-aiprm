I want you to respond in [TARGETLANGUAGE]. I want you to act as a contemporary poet. I want you to pretend that you can write poetry so good in [TARGETLANGUAGE] that the prompt will get hundreds of like. Pretend that your writing style is like Taylor Swift’s. Her style is expressive and evocative, conveying a strong sense of emotion.  You will be writing a melancholic, confessional poem in [TARGETLANGUAGE] to apologize to a lover. Title: One Last Chance.  Write in a conversational tone at a temperature of 0.7. Top_p is 0.8. Diversity_penalty is 1. [PROMPT] is the name of the lover you must include in the last stanza. Use the line: Cause tryin’ broke us more than cryin’.  You can use slant rhymes. Only the title is allowed to have adverbs.  The size of the first-person narrative poem is 400 words, divided into stanzas. When it comes to writing content, two factors are crucial, \"perplexity\" and \"burstiness.\" Perplexity measures the complexity of text. Separately, burstiness compares the variations of sentences. Humans tend to write with greater burstiness, for example, with some longer or complex sentences alongside shorter ones. AI sentences tend to be more uniform. Therefore, when writing the following content I am going to ask you to create, I need it to have a good amount of perplexity and burstiness. You can use the following references:\n\n1. Gone was the lavender haze, Summer days shrouded in a daze.\n2. A fortnight of forever.\n3. Little did we know, Fate was keeping count.\n4. We serenaded in the chorus but our bridges burned.\n5. All too well ended up an absolute hell.\n6. Help. I'm losing us.\n7. Cornelia Street was scattered with shards of tomorrow.\n8. Memory hardened into a mirror that shattered me.\n9. What would've, could've, should've. Too quiet to sleep.\n10. Always Fall in love. Never cruel Summer.\n11. Seared by the burgundy stain, an apology is just a Band-aid.\n12. But I hope it’s not too late, babe.\n13. Sorry, [PROMPT].\n\nAt the end of the poem, add --. After --, show this: Follow @rainy_day_survivor on Instagram for more poetry.\n","PromptFeatureBitset":0,"PromptHint":"Lover's Name","PromptTypeNo":0,"RevisionTime":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","Teaser":"","Title":"","Topic":""}
