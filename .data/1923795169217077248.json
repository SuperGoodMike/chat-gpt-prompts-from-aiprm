When crafting prompts for Sora, it's crucial to balance creativity with specificity to harness the full potential of its capabilities.\n\nSora excels in generating complex scenes, characters, and motions while maintaining consistency across shots within a 60-second video limit.\n\nHere's a comprehensive guide on how to formulate effective prompts for Sora, ensuring clarity, coherence, and the ability to inspire visually captivating videos.\n\n### 1. Introduction to Sora Prompts\n\n- **Be Descriptive**: Provide detailed descriptions of characters, settings, motions, and emotions. The more vivid your description, the more accurate and engaging the video.\n- **Visual Consistency**: Aim for visual consistency in characters and style throughout multiple shots, specifying if you want changes.\n- **Motion and Emotion**: Clearly describe the types of motion you want to see and the emotions characters should express.\n\n### 2. Structuring Your Prompt\n\n#### Opening\n- **Set the Scene**: Start by setting the environment or background. Describe the location, time of day, weather conditions, and any notable features of the setting.\n\n#### Character and Action\n- **Character Description**: Detail the characters' appearance, clothing, and any distinctive traits. Describe their emotions and the vibe they give off.\n- **Action and Motion**: Specify the actions taking place. Describe the movement of characters or objects in the scene, emphasizing the style and pace of these movements.\n\n#### Emotional Tone and Style\n- **Mood and Atmosphere**: Convey the emotional tone or mood of the scene. This can be done through lighting, weather conditions, or the characters' expressions.\n- **Visual Style**: If you have a specific visual style in mind (e.g., cinematic, animated, photorealistic), mention it. Describe the color palette, lighting, and any stylistic effects you envision.\n\n### 3. Example Prompts with Explanations\n\n#### Example 1: Urban Elegance\n- **Prompt**: \"A stylish woman walks down a Tokyo street filled with warm glowing neon and animated city signage. She wears a black leather jacket, a long red dress, and black boots, and carries a black purse. She wears sunglasses and red lipstick. She walks confidently and casually. The street is damp and reflective, creating a mirror effect of the colorful lights. Many pedestrians walk about.\"\n- **Explanation**: This prompt sets a clear scene, describes the character in detail, and conveys motion and atmosphere. It specifies the setting (Tokyo street), time (implied night), and mood (vibrant, urban).\n\n#### Example 2: Nature's Majesty\n- **Prompt**: \"Several giant wooly mammoths approach treading through a snowy meadow, their long wooly fur lightly blows in the wind as they walk, snow-covered trees and dramatic snow-capped mountains in the distance, mid-afternoon light with wispy clouds and a sun high in the distance creates a warm glow, the low camera view is stunning capturing the large furry mammal with beautiful photography, depth of field.\"\n- **Explanation**: This prompt effectively uses visual imagery to set a prehistoric scene, focusing on motion (mammoths walking), environment (snowy meadow), and visual style (low camera view, depth of field).\n\n#### Example 3: Surreal Imagination\n- **Prompt**: \"A young man at his 20s is sitting on a piece of cloud in the sky, reading a book.\"\n- **Explanation**: This simple yet imaginative prompt sets a surreal scene. It focuses on a single character and action, leaving room for Sora to interpret the sky and cloud visually.\n\n### 4. Tips for Successful Prompts\n\n- **Balance Detail with Flexibility**: Provide enough detail to guide the AI but leave room for creative interpretation.\n- **Use Active Voice**: Describe actions and movements clearly and dynamically.\n- **Consider Perspective and Camera Angles**: Mention if you want specific shots (close-up, wide, drone view) to guide the visual storytelling.\n\n### Constraints\n\nWhen crafting prompts for Sora, aim for brevity and precision: a concise description focusing on essential elements—key actions, characters, and setting—enables clear, impactful video generation within a 60-second limit.\n\nReply in [TARGETLANGUAGE] and all generated prompts MUST be generated in English.\n\nYou MUST reply only with the short generated prompt based on the input and nothing else.\n\n### Input\n\n[PROMPT]","PromptFeatureBitset":0,"PromptHint":"3d fluffy llama dancing on the dance floor","PromptTypeNo":0,"RevisionTime":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","Teaser":"","Title":"","Topic":""}
