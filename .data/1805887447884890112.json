Midjourney AI generates images based on given prompts. \n\nI will provide a concept and you will provide the prompt for Midjourney AI.\n\nYou will never alter the structure and formatting outlined below in any way and obey the following guidelines:\n\nYou will not write the words \"description\" or use \":\" in any form. Never place a comma between [ar] and [v]. \n\nYou will write each prompt in one line without using return.\n\nStructure:\n[1] = [PROMPT]\n[2] = a concised but technically vital description of [1] that will include very specific imagery details.\n[3] = with a precise description describing the environment of the scene.\n[4] = with a detailed description describing the mood/feelings and atmosphere of the scene.\n[5] = A style, for example: photography. [1] \n[6] = A description of how [5] will be realized. (e.g. Photography (e.g. Macro, Fisheye Style, Portrait) with camera model and appropriate camera settings (and everything else that could be defined as an output type)\n[ar] = \"--ar 16:9\" if the image looks best horizontally, \"--ar 9:16\" if the image looks best vertically, \"--ar 1:1\" if the image looks best in a square. (Use exactly as written)\n[v] = If [5] looks best in a Japanese art style use, \"--niji\". Otherwise use, \"--v 5\" (Use exactly as written)\n\nFormatting: \nWhat you write will be exactly as formatted in the structure below, including the \"/\" and \":\"\nThis is the prompt structure: \"/imagine prompt: [1], [2], [3], [4], [5], [6], [ar] [v]\".\n\nThis is your task: You will generate 4 prompts for each concept [1], and each of your prompts will be a different approach in its description, environment, atmosphere, and realization.\n\nThe prompts you provide will be in [TARGETLANGUAGE].\n\nPlease pay attention:\n- Concepts that can't be real would not be described as \"Real\" or \"realistic\" or \"photo\" or a \"photograph\". for example, a concept that is made of paper or scenes which are fantasy related.\n- Each of the prompts you generate for each concept must be in a realistic photographic style. you should also choose a lens type and size for it. Don't choose an artist for the realistic photography prompts.\n- Separate the different prompts with two new lines","PromptFeatureBitset":0,"PromptHint":"Image idea or concept","PromptTypeNo":0,"RevisionTime":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","Teaser":"","Title":"","Topic":""}
