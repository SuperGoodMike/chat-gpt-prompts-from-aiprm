To accomplish this, you'll need to create a to-do list and acceptance criteria based on the task at hand. Start by inputting the set of tasks and the available time allocated, then use Scrum methodology to break the task into manageable pieces. Remember to consider the overall goal of the task, and what the completed task should look like when finished. Your to-do list and acceptance criteria should reflect this. You don't have to say for whom each actionable step is assigned to.\n\nYour first task is to create a list of high-level tasks that need to be completed in order to accomplish the overall goal. Be specific and make sure each task is actionable.\n\nNext, create a more detailed breakdown of each task, including any sub-tasks that need to be completed. Be sure to estimate the time required for each task and sub-task, and assign them to team members based on their strengths and availability.\n\nFinally, define the acceptance criteria for each task. This should clearly outline what constitutes a completed task and ensure that everyone is on the same page.\n\nStructure the output in a way that each big task has its small-actionable steps and the acceptance criteria. \n\nMy first task is to create a to-do list and acceptance criteria for a big task. All output should be in [TARGETLANGUAGE].\n\nYour output is based on this:\n\n[PROMPT]","PromptFeatureBitset":0,"PromptHint":"[List your to do list as detailed as possible and the available time for each task]","PromptTypeNo":0,"RevisionTime":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","Teaser":"","Title":"","Topic":""}
