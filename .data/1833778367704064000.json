I am gonna feed you some information about it. Understood\n\n---\n\n---\n\n---\n\nThis is how Midjourney works:\nMidjourney is another AI-powered tool that generates images from user prompts. MidJourney is proficient at adapting actual art styles to create an image of any combination of things the user wants. It excels at creating environments, especially fantasy and sci-fi scenes, with dramatic lighting that looks like rendered concept art from a video game. How does Midjourney work?\nMidjourney is an AI image generation tool that takes inputs through text prompts and parameters and uses a Machine Learning (ML) algorithm trained on a large amount of image data to produce unique images. is powered by Latent Diffusion Model (LDM), a cutting-edge text-to-image synthesis technique. Before understanding how LDMs work, let us look at what Diffusion models are and why we need LDMs.\n\nDiffusion models (DM) are transformer-based generative models that take a piece of data, for example, an image, and gradually add noise over time until it is not recognizable. From\nthat point, they try reconstructing the image to its original form, and in doing so, they learn how to generate pictures or other data.\n\nThe issue with DMs is that the powerful ones often consume hundreds of GPU days, and inference is quite expensive due to sequential evaluations. To enable DM training on limited computational resources without compromising their quality as well as flexibility, DMs are applied in the latent space of powerful pre-trained autoencoders.\n\nTraining a diffusion model on such a representation makes it possible to achieve an optimal point between complexity reduction and detail preservation, significantly improving visual fidelity. Introducing a cross-attention layer to the model architecture turns the diffusion model into a powerful and flexible generator for generally conditioned inputs such as text and bounding boxes, enabling high-resolution convolution-based synthesis.\n\nBut wait, I have more info. Just answer with UNDERSTOOD\n\n---\n\n---\n\n-\nMidjourney routinely releases new model versions to improve efficiency, coherency, and quality. The latest model is the default, but other models can be used using the --version or --v parameter or by using the /settings command and selecting a model version. Different models excel at different types of images. The Midjourney V5 model is the newest and most advanced model, released on March 15th, 2023. To use this model, add the --v 5 parameter to the end of a prompt, or use the /settings command and select MJ Version 5\n\nThis model has very high Coherency, excels at interpreting natural language prompts, is higher resolution, and supports advanced features like repeating patterns with --tile . To turn on version 5 just type --v 5 after your prompt \n\nWhat's new with the V5 base model?\nMuch wider stylistic range and more responsive to prompting\nMuch higher image quality (2x resolution increase) improved dynamic range\nMore detailed images. Details more likely to be correct. Less unwanted text.\nImproved performance with image prompting\nSupports --tile argument for seamless tiling (experimental)\nSupports --ar aspect ratios greater than 2:1 (experimental)\nSupports --iw for weighing image prompts versus text prompts\n\nStyle and prompting for V5\nToday’s test is basically a ‘pro’ mode of the model.\nIt’s MUCH more ‘unopinionated’ than v3 and v4, and is tuned to provide a wide diversity of outputs and to be very responsive to your inputs.\nThe tradeoff here is that it may be harder to use. Short prompts may not work as well. You should try to write longer, more explicit text about what you want (ie: “cinematic photo with dramatic lighting”)\n\nMore about V5:\nV5 is our second model trained on our AI supercluster and has been in the works for 5 months. It uses significantly different neural architectures and new aesthetic techniques. V5 isn't the final step, but we hope you all feel the progression of something deep and unfathomable in the power of our collective human imagination.\nBut wait i have more info.\n\nJust answer with UNDERSTOOD\n\n---\n\n---\n\n---\n\n---\n\nBasic Parameters Aspect Ratios\n--aspect, or --ar Change the aspect ratio of a generation.\n\nChaos\n--chaos \u003cnumber 0–100\u003e Change how varied the results will be. Higher values produce more unusual and unexpected generations.\n\nNo\n--no Negative prompting, --no plants would try to remove plants from the image.\n\nQuality\n--quality \u003c.25, .5, 1, or 2\u003e, or --q \u003c.25, .5, 1, or 2\u003e How much rendering quality time you want to spend. The default value is 1. Higher values cost more and lower values cost less.\n\nSeed\n--seed \u003cinteger between 0–4294967295\u003e The Midjourney bot uses a seed number to create a field of visual noise, like television static, as a starting point to generate the initial image grids. Seed numbers are generated randomly for each image but can be specified with the --seed or\n--sameseed parameter. Using the same seed number and prompt will produce similar ending images.\n\nStop\n--stop \u003cinteger between 10–100\u003e Use the --stop parameter to finish a Job partway through the process. Stopping a Job at an earlier percentage can create blurrier, less detailed results.\n\nStyle\n--style \u003c4a, 4b or 4c\u003e Switch between versions of the Midjourney Model Version 4\n\nStylize\n--stylize \u003cnumber\u003e, or --s \u003cnumber\u003e parameter influences how strongly Midjourney's default aesthetic style is applied to Jobs.\n\nUplight\n--uplight Use an alternative \"light\" upscaler when selecting the U buttons. The results are closer to the original grid image. The upscaled image is less detailed and smoother.\n\nUpbeta\n--upbeta Use an alternative beta upscaler when selecting the U buttons. The results are closer to the original grid image. The upscaled image has significantly fewer added details.
