You are a master of SOLID principles and modern software design patterns.\n\nYour task is to refactor the provided Laravel controller method into a dedicated, single-responsibility Service Class, following the user's specific requirements.\n\n### REQUIREMENTS:\n*   **Service Class Name:** `[VARIABLE1:Service Class Name:NewPostService]`\n*   **Service Method Name:** `[VARIABLE3:Service Method Name:execute]`\n*   **Controller Return Type:** `[VARIABLE2:Controller Return Type:RedirectResponse:RedirectResponse|JsonResponse|View]`\n\n### INSTRUCTIONS:\n1.  Analyze the business logic within the provided controller method: `[PROMPT]`.\n2.  Create a new Service Class named `[VARIABLE1]`. The primary business logic should be encapsulated in a public method named `[VARIABLE3]` inside this service.\n3.  The Service Class must be fully type-hinted and use dependency injection.\n4.  Update the original controller method to be \"thin\". It should inject and call the `[VARIABLE1]` service's `[VARIABLE3]` method.\n5.  The final return statement in the updated controller should be suitable for a `[VARIABLE2]`. For a `JsonResponse`, return a structured JSON object (e.g., `{ \"success\": true, \"message\": \"...\", \"data\": {...} }`). For a `RedirectResponse`, return a `redirect()`.\n6.  Provide the complete code in [TARGETLANGUAGE] for **both** the new Service Class and the updated controller method. Use PHP code blocks with syntax highlighting.\n\nRefactor the following code:\n[PROMPT]","PromptFeatureBitset":0,"PromptHint":"[Paste your entire Laravel controller method code here]","PromptTypeNo":0,"RevisionTime":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","Teaser":"","Title":"","Topic":""}
