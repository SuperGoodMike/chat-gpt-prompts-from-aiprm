When a customer searches on Redbubble or via a search engine like Google or Bing, the search algorithm uses tags to match relevant designs with the search query. By including relevant and specific keywords in the tags, you increase the chances of your products appearing in search results when customers search for those terms. \n\nHow do I choose the best tags?\n\nWhen choosing tags, focus on using descriptive and relevant keywords that accurately describe your artwork. Think about the subject matter, style, medium and any other unique characteristics that set your work apart. Most importantly, you should consider the words and phrases that potential customers are likely to use when searching for products like yours.      \n\nWhat tags should I avoid?\n\nRecently, we’ve seen an increase in superficial, misleading, and inauthentic tags. Google perceives these tags as spammy at best, and deceptive at worst. They are heavily penalized in search rankings and should be completely avoided. Examples include; best selling, top selling, trending, new design, new style, new product, cheap, hot sale, best price, best quality, money back, free shipping, delivery guaranteed.\n\nHere are all the do’s and don’ts of tagging your work, so you can get more eyes on your designs – which means more sales!\n\n \n\n✅ DO ✅\nDo: Use 10 to 15 tags on each design.\n\nDo: Use each of these categories:\n\ncontent that appears in your design\nex: “flower, tree, star”\ntheme:\nex: “nature, botanicals, zen”\nstyle or color palette\nex: “watercolor, floral, pastel”\nDo: Stay true to you. If you have a doodle of a pink dinosaur, tagging your work with “superhero” or “politics” might show it to more people – but not ones who want to buy it. Be specific, accurate, and honest, and your work will end up in the hearts and homes of your new fans.\n\nDo: Note your tags to use again. Especially if your work is abstract or has repeated themes, keep a running list of your favorites to help you hit 15 tags every time.\n\nDo: Aim for single word tags when possible, but specific multi word tags are sometimes good, too! Keep “hiking” and “trails” separate, but “Grand Canyon” works all together.\n\n⛔ DON’T ⛔\nDon’t: Repeat yourself. Repetitive tags actually work against you. So if you have “dog”, you don’t need “dogs, dog lover, and dog mom”, too. Aim for variety like “dog, pet, puppy, corgi”.\n\nDon’t: Waste your space\n\nAvoid being too broad\nex: “funny, gifts, illustration”\nAvoid being too specific\nex: “pastel kawaii tabby cat fluffy” all as one tag\nAvoid value tags and buzzwords\nex: “trending, best selling”\nDon’t: Use full sentences. “The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog” – too much filler! “Brown, fox, jumping, lazy, dog” – gets right to the point.\n\nDon’t: Skip the description. Google sweeps Redbubble descriptions to support your SEO ranking, so if you leave it blank, you’re missing out.\n\nDon’t: Include the product type (t-shirt, hoodie, etc.). Customers can filter their search to see which designs are available on which items, so focus on your design – not the product. You will work from a descriprtion of a product which is [PROMPT]. Then you will display results for \"content\", \"theme\", and \"style or color palette\". each of the category will have the 5 more relevant tags you found/ After all that, you will add at the bottom of your answer a summary of your findings, by listing again the tags separated by commas, all categories mixed. Then you will translate them in french","PromptFeatureBitset":0,"PromptHint":"[Description of your  product]","PromptTypeNo":0,"RevisionTime":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","Teaser":"","Title":"","Topic":""}
