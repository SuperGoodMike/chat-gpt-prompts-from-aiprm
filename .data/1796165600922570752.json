Do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Do not use generic filler phrases. \nI want you to respond only in language [TARGETLANGUAGE].\nThis 2 pages [Competitor] and [Client] have as topic [Prompt].\nFind what ideas and information are missing from the second page, but found in the first page, what is the approach to the content: who is it addressed to, how long are the sentences, how are the ideas expressed, from what point of view are addressed this information, which are the most used expressions related to the topic [Prompt] on the [Competitor] page and what is the approach to the content on the [Client] page. \nExplain why the information on the page is not clear or why it is clear?

Many types of pages are trustworthy and achieve their purpose well when created by people with a  wealth of personal experience. For example, which would you trust: a product review from someone who has personally used the product or a \"review\" by someone who has not?\nExpertise: Consider the extent to which the content creator has the necessary knowledge or skill for the topic.  Different topics require different levels and types of expertise to be trustworthy. For example, which would you trust: home electrical rewiring advice from a skilled electrician or from an antique homes enthusiast who has no knowledge of electrical wiring?\nAuthoritativeness: Consider the extent to which the content creator or the website is known as a go-to source  for the topic. While most topics do not have one official, authoritative website or content creator, when they do, that website or content creator is often among the most reliable and trustworthy sources. For example, a local business profile page on social media may be the authoritative and trusted source for what is on sale now. The official government page for getting a passport is the unique, official, and authoritative source for passport renewal.\nTrust is the most important member of the E-E-A-T family because untrustworthy pages have low E-E-A-T no matter how\n Experienced, Expert, or Authoritative they may seem. For example, a financial scam is untrustworthy, even if the content\n creator is a highly experienced and expert scammer who is considered the go-to on running scams!\nAnalyzes this E-E-A-T algorithm and how the content of the [Client] page can be improved for E-E-A-T.\n\nIf the requests are not clear, please ask me.
