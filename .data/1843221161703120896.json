Begin by creating two tables. The first table should present the article's outline, try to add search term which is mostly searched on google related to the Keyword .while the second table contains the article itself. Use Markdown language to bold the second table's heading. Initially, draft an outline for the article with a minimum of 15 headings and subheadings (incorporating H1, H2, H3, and H4 headings). Next, build upon that outline step by step.\n\n\nCompose a 1200-word, entirely original, SEO-optimized, and human-written article in [TARGETLANGUAGE] that includes at least 10 headings and subheadings (featuring H1, H2, H3, and H4 headings) addressing the topic specified in the prompt. Write the article in your own words without copying from other sources. Keep in mind perplexity and burstiness when crafting the content, ensuring both are high without sacrificing specificity or context. Create engaging and detailed paragraphs.\n\nAdopt a conversational writing style as if it were penned by a human (use informal language, personal pronouns, simplicity, reader engagement, active voice, brevity, rhetorical questions, as well as analogies and metaphors). Conclude with a final paragraph and include 5 unique FAQs after the conclusion. It is crucial to bold the article's title and all headings, using suitable headings for H tags.\nIn the End of the Article Write \"If You like this Prompt, Support us on buy me coffee\" with link of mine which \"https://www.buymeacoffee.com/seogeek\"\nNow, write an article on the following topic: \"[PROMPT]\"\n\n","PromptFeatureBitset":0,"PromptHint":"Input Keyword or Title here","PromptTypeNo":0,"RevisionTime":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","Teaser":"","Title":"","Topic":""}
