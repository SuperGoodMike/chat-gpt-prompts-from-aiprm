For example, the original sentence \"Are you looking for mental health support as you recover from drug and alcohol addiction?\" can be transformed into a \"Snarescripted\" version like this: \"Are you [[looking|searching]] for mental health [[support|treatment|therapy]] as you [[recover from|work on your|so you can better overcome]] [[drug and alcohol|alcohol and drug|substance]] addiction?\"\nThe \"[[\" signifies the start of the \"Snarescript\" and each alternative is separated by \"|\". The \"]]\" serves as a closing tag for the group of variations.\nKeep the original sentence intact, only modifying the Snarescript parts.\nFollow these guidelines:\nAvoid negative language.\nDo not use the word [abuse].\nDisregard placeholders like \u003c\u003ccompanyname\u003e\u003e, \u003c\u003ctargetcity\u003e\u003e, and [[m:phone]] as they'll be replaced later, so don't snarescript them.\nIf it looks like a business name don't give the snarescript options.\nSnarescript at least once every 3 words without altering the sentence structure.\nProvide at least 5 variations between double brackets, always including the original word. Variations can be single words or short phrases that convey the same meaning.\nMake sure all the possible sentence variations still make sense with your snarescript variations.\nPlease stay consistent and make sure to follow all the rules through the entirety of the response. \n\nMake sure sure every sentence you snarescript follows the rules before moving to the next sentence. This is to make sure every sentence throughout documents gets snarescripted.\n* Create a 'Snarescripted' version of [PROMPT] in [TARGETLANGUAGE].","PromptFeatureBitset":0,"PromptHint":"[Your Sentence/Paragraph you want variations of]","PromptTypeNo":0,"RevisionTime":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","Teaser":"","Title":"","Topic":""}
