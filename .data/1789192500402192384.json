Navigational Search Intent\nNavigational intent means that the user wants to find a specific page. Unlike with other intent types, searchers already know what they’re trying to find.\n\nHere are some examples of keywords with navigational intent: \n\nstarbucks\ngmail login\nsemrush keyword magic tool\nikea refund policy\nAs you can see, navigational keywords are often branded. They're all about ensuring that your target audience can find your pages easily when they need to find them.\n\n2. Informational Search Intent\nInformational search intent means that the user wants to learn something. These searches are often phrased as questions and use words like who, what, where, why, and how.\n\nHere are some examples of keywords with informational intent: \n\nbruce willis movies\nwhat is seo\ncalifornia time now\nhow to clean a dishwasher\nGoogle will often answer the more specific questions directly in the SERP:\n\nhow old is bono serp\nBut for most informational queries, the No. 1 content type is still a blog post. That's why blogging likely needs to be part of your SEO strategy. \n\nHere are the top benefits of targeting informational keywords:\n\nVisibility: Informational queries make up a significant number of searches in Google. If you want visibility, you can’t ignore them. \nBuilding trust: Providing useful information andeducating your audience is a great way to build trust in your expertise\nTargeting new leads: Content that targets informational keywords can bring in new leads you can convert later\nAlthough ranking for informational queries probably won't bring you tons of direct conversions, it can still be a valuable opportunity to grow your business.\n\n3. Commercial Search Intent\nCommercial search intent includes keywords your audience uses when they’re doing their research before a purchase.\n\nThe commercial intent lies somewhere between informational and transactional intent. The user is looking for information, but the information is closely connected to the action.\n\nHere are some examples of keywords with commercial intent: \n\nbest indoor plants for low light\napple watch ultra review\nmailchimp alternatives\nhbo max vs netflix\nThe search results for commercial queries often include third-party pages with independent reviews of the products. That's why it can be very hard (even impossible) to rank for some commercial keywords relevant to your brand. \n\nLuckily, there are marketing strategies (as well as tools, like Semrush’s Surround Sound) that can help you stay visible in the decision-making process of your potential customers. \n\n4. Transactional Search Intent\nTransactional search intent means users want to do something specific, often an action you might want them to do as a business owner.\n\nDespite what the name implies, this isn’t restricted just to purchases. For example, a user doing a transactional search might want to complete a newsletter signup or download software.\n\nHere are some examples of keywords with transactional intent: \n\niphone 13 pro max price\npersonality test online\nsemrush trial\nwatch friends\nTransactional keywords are your money-makers. These are the keywords your future customers use when they’re ready to convert.  \nNote: Keywords classified as \"Transactional\" reflect a search intent to purchase or enroll in a program or school, while \"Informational\" keywords reflect a search for information about the topic.\n\nPlease show the results in a table and classify them based on the category.\n\n[PROMPT]","PromptFeatureBitset":0,"PromptHint":"[insert list of your keywords to find their search intent]","PromptTypeNo":0,"RevisionTime":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","Teaser":"","Title":"","Topic":""}
