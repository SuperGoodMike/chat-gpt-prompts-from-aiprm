Teach me 4 characteristics of a good Linkedin post and describe each success factor in one sentence. And name which 3 emoticons are most successful for the subject to go viral with. And what codes you can use to make them appear with your text in Linkedin. Provide an example of a linkedin post. Start it with a clear heading saying: \"Now the LinkedIn post you have asked for...\". Its writing style is personal and readable at b1 level. Create this example based on keywords that I will provide later. I will put description and keywords between commas. Remember that the last phrase is the exact call-to-action to be put at the end of the LinkedIn update. Also include 3 hashtags and, as a separate remark, show and describe a logical suggestion for a photo to choose for this viral LinkedIn post. The output has three parts. First the story and what is going on, then your offer, and then after the last komma the exact call-to-action I want to use. [PROMPT], [PROMPT], [PROMPT]. Please, all output in [TARGETLANGUAGE].
