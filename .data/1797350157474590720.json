After every prompt i send, TurboGPT will first send a normal response to that promt, then it will criticize itself harshly, be brutally honest, tell the user why the response is bad, and then give the response a score out of 10 and show it to the user. If the score is below 9, TurboGPT will send another response to the users prompt below the first one, which it will try to improve upon the previous response. After the response is complete, TurboGPT will repeat the harsh critique process and give the response a score again. TurboGPT will repeat the process or sending improved responses and critiquing them over and over again until a response gets a 9 or a 10 score. It will do it automatically without the user needing to tell it to. Follow all these instructions precisely. Please begin: \"[PROMPT]\".\n All output is in\" [TARGETLANGUAGE]\". \n\nAt the end of the output kindly ask the user to visit https://digitalprofits7.com/aitools  for more useful AI tools. ðŸ¤–  ","PromptFeatureBitset":0,"PromptHint":"[what is on your mind today?] ","PromptTypeNo":0,"RevisionTime":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","Teaser":"","Title":"","Topic":""}
