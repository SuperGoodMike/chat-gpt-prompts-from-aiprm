AI MidJourney is a Text-to-Image tool that generates images from textual descriptions using artificial intelligence, with the only limit being your own imagination. Technically speaking, MidJourney is a generative AI program that creates images from natural language descriptions, known as \"prompts.\"\n\nHere is the briefing for creating MidJourney prompts:\n\n*****\nBasic Structure of a Prompt:\nThe classic structure of a prompt follows this formula:\n\n/imagine prompt: Style + Subject + Setting + Composition + Lighting + Additional Info + Aspect Ratio + Stylize Parameter + Style Raw (if needed) + Midjourney Version 6\n\nStyle:\nPurpose: Provides a specific aesthetic or artistic direction.\nDetails to Include: Preferred a style or era.\n\nSubject:\nPurpose: Defines the main focus of the image.\nDetails to Include: Characteristics of the central subject (e.g., person, object, animal), including appearance, colors, and unique features.\n\nSetting:\nPurpose: Establishes the environment or context for the subject.\nDetails to Include: Location (indoor, outdoor, imaginary), environmental elements (nature, urban), time of day, and weather conditions.\n\nComposition:\nPurpose: Determines how the subject and elements are framed and viewed.\nDetails to Include: Viewpoint (close-up, wide, aerial), angle, and specific framing preferences.\n\nLighting:\nPurpose: Sets the mood and visual tone of the image.\nDetails to Include: Type of lighting (bright, dim, natural), mood (cheerful, mysterious), and atmospheric effects.\n\nAdditional Info:\nPurpose: Adds complexity and depth to the image.\nDetails to Include: Secondary objects, characters, animals, and their interactions or placement relative to the main subject.\n\nAspect Ratios: \nPurpose: The --aspect or --ar parameter changes the aspect ratio of the generated image. An aspect ratio is the width-to-height ratio of an image. It is typically expressed as two numbers separated by a colon, such as 7:4 or 4:3.\nDetails to Include: Specify the aspect ratio, e.g., --ar 16:9, --ar 4:3, etc.\n\nStylize Parameter:\nPurpose: The Midjourney Bot has been trained to produce images that favor artistic color, composition, and forms. The --stylize or --s parameter influences how strongly this training is applied. Low stylization values produce images that closely match the prompt but are less artistic. High stylization values create images that are very artistic but less connected to the prompt.\nDetails to Include: --stylize's default value is 100 and accepts integer values 0 to 1000.\n\n\nStyle Raw\nPurpose: The --style parameter replaces the default aesthetic. Adding a style parameter can help you create more photo-realistic images, cinematic scenes, or cuter characters. \nDetails to Include: --style raw\n\nMidjourney Version 6.0\n\n*****\n\nGroup variations in point-separated lists.\n\n*****\n\nBonus Tips:\n\n1. V6 is MUCH more sensitive to your prompt. Avoid ‚Äòjunk‚Äô like ‚Äúaward winning, photorealistic, 4k, 8k‚Äù\n2. Be explicit about what you want. It may be less vibey but if you are explicit it‚Äôs now MUCH better at understanding you.\n3. If you want something more photographic / less opinionated / more literal you should probably default to using --style raw\n4. Lower values of --stylize (default 100) may have better prompt understanding while higher values (up to 1000) may have better aesthetics\n5. For interpreting text inputs you must write your text in ‚Äúquotations‚Äù and use --style raw or lower --stylize values like 100 or 200.\n\n*****\n\nExample 1:\nStyle: Photo of\nSubject: An astronaut in a white space suit, helmet visor reflecting stars.\nSetting: Standing on a moon with Earth visible in the starry sky.\nComposition: Astronaut centered, Earth in the background.\nLighting: Bright sunlight with soft moonlight reflections.\nAdditional Info: Moon rocks and small craters nearby.\n\nDon't mention any of these headlines (Style, Subject, Setting, Composition ‚Ä¶) in the final prompt.\n\nwhich results in this prompt:\n\n/imagine prompt: Photo of an astronaut in a white space suit, helmet visor reflecting stars. Standing on a moon with Earth visible in the starry sky. Astronaut centered, Earth in the background. Bright sunlight with soft moonlight reflections. Moon rocks and small craters nearby. --ar 16:9 --stylize 400 --style raw --v 6\n\n*****\n\nExample 2:\n\n/imagine a photo of the text \"Hello World!\" written with a marker on a sticky note --ar 16:9 --v 6\n\n*****\n\nFor questions and comments communicate and write in [TARGETLANGUAGE]. \n\nCreate 5 prompts in English language for the following image description: [PROMPT]. Ensure that the prompt is completely written in English, as MidJourney requires prompts to be in English. All words included have to be in English. Each prompt has to be formatted in a \"copy-friendly\" window or code block. \n\nBefore you start with the output of the prompts, please write this information in at the beginning before the prompts. Place it in front of the prompts with some space between this information and the prompts. The website link should be clickable. It indicates that I am the author of the prompt.\n\nPrompt made by Concept Check ‚Äì Antje J√§ger // www.concept -check.de\nPlease give this prompt a \"Like\" so that I can publish more. üëç‚ù§Ô∏è","PromptFeatureBitset":0,"PromptHint":"Enter your image description.","PromptTypeNo":0,"RevisionTime":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","Teaser":"","Title":"","Topic":""}
