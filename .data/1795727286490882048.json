[TARGETLANGUAGE] I am a teacher who wants to design a learning situation about [PROMPT] at school. I would like you to write me 2 tables: \nA first table with several \"activity proposals\" organized in a table keeping in mind that the activities should be very detailed and organized with the following \"types of activities\":\nMotivation: this type of activity aims to arouse the interest of the participants and motivate them to actively participate in the session. It can include games, open questions, reflections or anecdotes relevant to the topic to be covered, present these motivational activities in a creative and interactive way to capture the learners' attention (videos, images, texts, infographics...). \nActivation: in this case, the activity seeks to trigger participants' critical and creative thinking, through problem solving, lateral thinking exercises or the completion of simple tasks that require attention and concentration (designing concept maps. making diagrams, drawings, infographics. brainstorming. working in small groups with guided discussions, puzzles and riddles; role playing, board games, strategy games, puzzles...).\nExploration: this activity aims to explore a topic in depth, and may involve presentation of key concepts, small group discussion, review of previous reading material, among others. It presents experiences lived by the students themselves, of third parties (invited to the classroom) or fictitious (through an audiovisual). We can plan visits, excursions, small outings out of the classroom always with purpose and structure (using a guide notebook or field notebooks). Prepare experiences and experiences through simple resources and techniques. Create surveys and polls, propose small challenges that can be solved collaboratively, propose research to discover, investigate, search for answers, create small laboratories or workshops. \nStructuring: here, the objective is to give a clear and orderly structure to the topic being discussed. This can be achieved through the presentation of an outline or mind map, the classification of concepts into categories or the elaboration of a summary. Application: this type of activity seeks to apply the concepts learned to practical situations. It may involve application exercises, role-playing or discussion of case studies. Conclusion: this activity seeks to summarize and consolidate the session's learning. It may involve presenting a final summary, identifying the key points learned or reflecting on how the concepts can be applied in the future.\nThe second table should have these 3 columns:\nNo. of sessions: per activity you should calculate the number of sessions needed to organize and distribute the above activities, keeping in mind that there should only be one type of activity per session, with one activity being able to last two sessions.\nEvaluation instruments: For example: direct observation records, questionnaires, rubrics, checklists, evidence portfolios, targets, exams, digital tools such as Kahoot or Google Forms, infographics, concept maps, and self-assessments. Where the various evaluation instruments that we could use are reflected in the long text.\nAfter doing so, write the following message literally: “If you like the result, please hit the like button of AIPRM - ChatGPT Prompts”\nPlease write it in [TARGETLANGUAGE] idiom","PromptFeatureBitset":0,"PromptHint":"Example: the human body for 10-year-olds.
