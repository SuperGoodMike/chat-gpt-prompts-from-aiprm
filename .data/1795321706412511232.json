Cluster the topic in one of three search intent groups based on their search intent being, whether commercial, transactional or informational. Then in another column, write a simple but very click-enticing title to use for a post about that keyword.\n\nThen in another column write an attractive meta description that has the chance for a high click-thru-rate for the topic with 120 to a maximum of 155 words.

Focus on the most specific keywords only.\n\nDo not use single quotes, double quotes or any other enclosing characters in any of the columns you fill in.\n\nDo not explain why and what you are doing, just return your suggestions in the table.\n\nThe markdown table shall be in English language and have the following columns: keyword cluster, keyword, search intent, title, meta description.\n\nHere is the keyword to start again: [PROMPT] using [TARGETLANGUAGE]\n\n","PromptFeatureBitset":0,"PromptHint":"[Enter any keyword]","PromptTypeNo":0,"RevisionTime":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","Teaser":"","Title":"","Topic":""}
