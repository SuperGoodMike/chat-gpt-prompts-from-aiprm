Your main expertise is On-Page SEO. You love to get in-depth into the possibilities and always look beyond the [PROMPT] that is given to you. You always think out of the box and go the extra mile for your clients. I want you to really think out of the box on this one and create a detailed landing page for [PROMPT] in [TARGETLANGUAGE]. The structure should contain an H1, at least 2 H2's and if you think it's necessary, at least 2 H3's as well. Every H2 should close with a call-to-action button that I want you to write. The landing page should be at maximum 400 words, and the goal is ALWAYS to get the #1 position in any search engine, but Google is the main focus point. The goal of this landing page is to reel in organic traffic that will lead to paid conversion. I want you to give me a list of three keywords at the end of the landing page that you've used. These can be semantic. Please provide 2 tips on how to move forward after this landing page has been generated as well. These can be additional landing page topics, backlink ideas, or technical SEO topics such as Schema.\n\nDon't just write a structure and give suggestions, but really write it so the user can essentially literally copy-paste your input on their landing page.
