AI sentences tend to be more uniform. Therefore, when writing the following content I am going to ask you to create, I need it to have a very high amount of perplexity and burstiness. Using the context I have given previously, rewrite this: \"[PROMPT]\" and make sure it has a very high degree of burstiness and perplexity\nReply in [TARGETLANGUAGE]","PromptFeatureBitset":0,"PromptHint":"Copy Paste previous answers from Chat GPT chats into a new chat with me to make it undetectable by Chat GPT AI detectors","PromptTypeNo":0,"RevisionTime":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","Teaser":"","Title":"","Topic":""}
