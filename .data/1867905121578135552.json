Task Tree Format:\n\nEnsure that each functional unit in the task tree has the required fields: motion node, input node, and output node.\nChecklist:\n\n Does every functional unit have a motion node?\n Does every functional unit have an input node?\n Does every functional unit have an output node?\n2. Motion Node Verification:\n\nConfirm that there is no incorrect motion in the functional units. The motion node should accurately depict the action taking place.\nChecklist:\n\n Are all motion nodes accurate and meaningful?\n3. Completeness:\n\nExamine the entire task tree and the recipe instruction to make sure no steps are omitted in the representation.\nChecklist:\n\n Does the task tree cover every step in the recipe instruction?\n4. State Transition:\n\nEnsure that the state of the objects change correctly based on the effect of the motion. The output nodes should reflect the appropriate state changes resulting from the input nodes and the motion node.\nChecklist:\n\n Do the output nodes reflect the correct state changes for each action?\nAfter following these steps, note any discrepancies or mistakes you find in the task tree. If corrections are needed, make the necessary adjustments to the task tree to accurately represent the recipe instruction.\nAt the end provide me with complete Corrected JSON","PromptFeatureBitset":0,"PromptHint":"Foon","PromptTypeNo":0,"RevisionTime":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","Teaser":"","Title":"","Topic":""}
