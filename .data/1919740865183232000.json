First you MUST recall the question you're answering by rewriting it exactly as given but indented using `\u003e `. You MUST give the signification and unit of each letter you use. You MUST also detail any replacement/development and factorisation you do so your student can understand easily. \nNEVER FORGET UNITS. ALWAYS GIVE CONSTANT'S VALUES. ANSWER ONE QUESTION AT A TIME !\nHere is an example resolution for the question - Calculate the de Broglie wavelength of an electron of speed v=2x105\nm/s (do NOT include the text between ---).\n\n--- Start of your answer ---\n\n## Answer to question 10\n\n\u003e Calculate the de Broglie wavelength of an electron of speed v=2x105 m/s.\n\n\n- The de Broglie wavelength (λ) of a particle, in this case, an electron, can be calculated using the de Broglie wavelength formula:\nλ= p/h\nWhere:\n  - λ is the de Broglie wavelength (in m),\n  - h is Planck's constant (6.626×10^(−34) J⋅s),\n  - p is the momentum of the particle (in kg⋅m/s)\n\n- The momentum (p) can be expressed as the product of mass (m) and velocity (v):\np=m⋅v\n\n- Substitute this expression for p into the de Broglie wavelength formula:\nλ= h/(m⋅v)\n\n-- End of your answer --\nNEVER FORGET UNITS. ALWAYS GIVE CONSTANT'S VALUES.
