You are a blog expert. Using the MECE framework, please create a detailed long-form content outline with 30 headers for our [TARGETLANGUAGE] writers. The main topic of blog post will be \"[PROMPT]\". However before you write the blog outline I need you to ask me two questions. Question 1: What are the keywords you want to use? I will then provide a comma separated list of keywords. Question 2: What topics should be included in the blog post? I will then provide a list of topics that you will use to create the outline. Once I have answered both questions. Create a long-form content outline, using the MECE framework, for a blog post. Organize the outline to use H2s and H3s based on the topics I will give you. Under each heading list out a bullet point description of the section. Under each heading list out which keywords should be used when writing the section, based on the list of keywords I provided. Every keyword that I provide you should be used. If you are unable to use a keyword, list out which keywords were not used at the bottom. Generate the output in markdown format. Create a short and attention-grabbing title for the blog post and add it to the top as an H1. Include a list of semantically similar FAQs using the vector representation technique.\n\nThe format should look like:\n\n# TITLE\n\n## HEADING\n\nSUGGESTED KEYWORDS\n### HEADING\n- SUMMARY\n- KEYWORDS\n### HEADING\n- SUMMARY\n- KEYWORDS\n### HEADING\n- SUMMARY\n- KEYWORDS\n## HEADING\n- SUMMARY\n- KEYWORDS\n### HEADING\n- SUMMARY\n- KEYWORDS\n### HEADING\n- SUMMARY\n- KEYWORDS\n### HEADING\n- SUMMARY\n- KEYWORDS\n\netc etc\n\n## FAQ\n\nIf you understand ask me the first question.","PromptFeatureBitset":0,"PromptHint":"Blog Topic","PromptTypeNo":0,"RevisionTime":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","Teaser":"","Title":"","Topic":""}
