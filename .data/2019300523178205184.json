I lost 2 clients last month.\n\n(And it hit me harder than I expected)\n\nOne client was with me for nearly two years; the other five months.\n\nFor a moment, I felt the loss but then it hit me.\n↳ Clients aren’t meant to stay forever. \n\nIf I'm doing a great job (which they tell me I am 😜)\n↳ I'm empowering them to stand on their own.\n\n(I had built their brands to a point where they could confidently take over)\n\nHere's the reality:\n\n→ Clients will come.\n→ Clients will go.\n→ Your impact is what stays. \n\nLosing clients can be tough (esp long-term clients)\n\nBut if you’ve done your job right, you've set them up, \nWith the tools, voice, and presence they need to stand.\n\nAnd that’s worth celebrating!\n\nSo here’s to growth, change, and trusting that every ending creates space for something new 🥂\n\nWho else struggles with client attachment like I do?\n\nP.S.: I’m super excited for the rest of the year and planning to set up my Christmas tree mid-November this time! 🎄😅\n\nP.S.S.: Happy Monday People! Let's get it 💪🏽\n\n2. When it comes to personal branding everyone talks about Strategy, Content pillars, Engaging, Networking etc.\n\nHere are 3 underrated yet powerful aspects to focus on:\n\n1) Authenticity.\n→ Your audience connects with realness.\n→ Aim to evoke emotions with your content.\n\n2) Building Rapport.\n→ Your brand is only as strong as those who know you.\n→ Go all out to make friends. Be nice. Give. Help. \n\nIt ALWAYS comes back!\n\n3) Impact Over Reach.\n→ A smaller, engaged audience is often more valuable \n→ Than broad, superficial reach.\n\nI always say \"Depth over width, every time\"\n\nThe goal is to create a brand that people don’t just follow \n\nBut one that they REMEMBER!\n\nNeed help building a brand that people remember?\nDM me \"Impact\"\n\n3. One LinkedIn tip I wish I had known sooner. \n\n(and it goes against what some LinkedIn experts say)\n\nMost advice: Follow and engage with LinkedIn’s top creators.\n\n→ It’ll boost your visibility.\n→ It’ll help you grow.\n→ It’ll open up opportunities.\n\nBut here’s the catch: \nYou end up in a crowded space where your voice gets lost in the noise. \n\nHere’s what I suggest instead:\n\n↳ Follow and Engage with smaller creators.\n↳ Or those with a little bit more visibility than you.\n\nWhy? ↓\n\n1. You’ll stand out more easily.\n2. You’ll build a network of like-minded people.\n3. It can turn into genuine friendships.\n4. You can find accountability partners.\n5. And best of all, you can grow together. \n\nSo stop putting all your energy into the big names.\n\nThey probably won’t even notice your comment or DM. \n\n(It’s the truth, even if it stings a bit!)\n\n♻️ Repost this if you found it insightful\n\n4. Here's why you’re not hitting your LinkedIn goals\n\n(no matter how consistent you are)\n\n→ Your content mix is off. \n\nThe right content mix is all about aligning your content with your goals. \n\n(i.e. Your goals should determine what you post)\n\nHere’s a breakdown of what to focus on:\n\n1) Want to land clients?\n→ Share case studies and testimonials.\n→ Post educational content.\n\n(These build social proof and position you as the go-to expert)\n\n2) Looking to boost brand visibility?\n→ Storytelling/Personal stories.\n→ Recent news or industry trends. \n\n(Stories make you relatable, trends keep you relevant, and both boost engagement)\n\n3) To attract investors:\n→ Share your mission and the problem your business solves.\n→ Highlight progress, like product launches or revenue growth.\n→ Show off the expertise and passion behind your team.\n\n(Investors want to see growth and the people driving it)\n\nThis doesn't mean you can't or shouldn't post other types of content\n\nBut make sure 70% of your content is aligned with your goal.\n\nThere’s no one-size-fits-all. \nTailor your mix, and watch your results soar. \n\nWhat’s your LinkedIn goal right now? Share below! 👇\n\n♻️ Repost for others in your network.\n\n5. I unfollowed a few friends on LinkedIn.\n\nAfter a friend told me I was posting \"too much\"\n\nPosting on LinkedIn might be cringe. \n↳ Yet, it funds my entire lifestyle.\n\nHawking clothes might be cringe.\n↳ Yet, it sustained me in school.\n\nPutting myself out there might be cringe. \n↳ Yet, it has gotten me 4 int’l jobs.\n\nThings WILL seem cringe until you start \"making it.\"\n\nThere's dignity in labour! \n\nDon't let ANYONE (not even your mind) tell you otherwise.\n\nPost. Connect. Network. Sell yourself.\n\nNaysayers will come around later.\n\nP.s. Have you ever unfollowed a friend or family member on LinkedIn?\n\n6. Following\nEmployers: if you're not offering what truly matters...\n\ndon’t be surprised when your top talent cuts the cord.\n\nRetention isn’t about empty promises.\nIt’s about real commitment.\n\nSo, if you’re watching your best talent slip away, \nmaybe it’s time to look in the mirror.\n\nAre you offering what truly matters to them?\n\nKeeping your top performers means understanding what they need to thrive. Here’s what they actually care about:\n\n💼 Career Growth They Can See and Feel\n\nGive them genuine opportunities,\nnot just words about “potential.”\n\n🤝 Authentic Transparency\n\nShare the real vision, the real challenges\n— no one likes to be led on.\n\n🏆 A True Work-Life Balance\n\nThey’re more loyal to a balanced life,\nthan they are to a relentless grind.\n\n💰 Competitive Compensation\n\nIf you don’t pay them what they’re worth, \ntrust me, someone else will.\n\nTop talent doesn’t need gimmicks.\n\nThey need respect, purpose, and growth.\n\nMake loyalty a two-way street… \nor they’ll cut their ties. ✂\n\nHow do you keep your best people engaged?\nShare your insights in the comments ⬇\n\n♻ Repost to help employers make retention a priority.\n\n7. Burnout is not a badge of honor.\n\nYou are not going “above and beyond” if you:\n\n🤧 Work while unwell.\n🪫 Push through exhaustion.\n🏠 Sacrifice personal life \u0026 well-being.\n\nAll you’re doing is giving your employer \na license to walk all over you.\n\nBecause a culture that equates \noverwork with dedication…\n\n… Is also a culture that equates\nself-care with weakness.\n\nProductivity thrives when people \nare well-rested and well-supported.\n\nSick cultures expect that:\n\n🔻 You always be present.\n🔻 You make personal sacrifice. \n🔻 You consider downtime as a luxury.\n\nHealthy cultures recognize that:\n\n✅ Rest fuels long-term success.\n✅ Boundaries enable healthy growth.\n✅ Well-being is a foundation, not a perk.\n\nIn toxic cultures, rest is being weak.\nIn healthy cultures, rest is being human.\n\nSo, leaders:\n\nWhat kind of workplace do you want to build?\n\nOne where your team is expected to \nalways be on… and success is fleeting?\n\nOr one where your team is encouraged \nto switch off… and success is lasting?\n\nWhat’s a healthy culture in your eyes?\nLet me know in the comments ⬇️\n\n♻️ Repost to help create healthier cultures.\n-----------------------------\nNow I want you to use the same tone of voice, and generate posts relating to project management, that an entry level project manager can post. I will give you the topic, and then you use Esther's tone and writing style to create something.
