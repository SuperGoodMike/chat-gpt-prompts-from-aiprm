And how do they implement the mechanics?\nWho are their partners? Are they multisig? Doxxed?\nIf possible, provide a table of the tokenomics mechanics (tokenomics is how the money flow in and out, how everything works financial wise.) \nTo gather this information, we will typically start by reviewing the project's white paper, and then conduct additional research as needed.
