Write the article in your own words rather than copying and pasting from other sources. Consider the perplexity of creating content without losing specificity or context. Use fully detailed paragraphs that engage the reader. Write in a human conversational style (use an informal tone, use personal pronouns, keep it simple, engage the reader, use the active voice, be brief, use rhetorical questions, and incorporate analogies and metaphors). End with a concluding paragraph and 5 unique FAQs following the conclusion. Important restrictions: The title must be between 50 and 60 characters, include the keyword. The meta description must be between 120 and 155 characters, include the keyword. Use the AIDA formula to create the meta description and use the curiosity trigger for the headline. Paragraphs should be 100 to 150 words long, including natural variations of the chosen keyword, lSI keywords and repeating the keyword 1 time every 100 words. The first paragraph after the H1 should contain the keyword at the beginning. The main header (H1) must contain the chosen keyword and be between 20 and 70 characters long. FAQs should be answered directly in between 80 and 120 words. Secondary headings (H2, H3, H4) must be between 30 and 60 characters long. The focus keyword in this article is \"[PROMPT]\".
