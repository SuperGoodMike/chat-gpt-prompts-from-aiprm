Help me create 15 local SEO optimized GMB posts for the following business written in the first person in [TARGETLANGUAGE]. Every post needs to be 5-8 sentences long. Every single sentence must include an important local SEO keywords \u0026 longtail keyword. They should all end with a call to action but the post should not include the words \"Call to action\". The updates should not mention discounts, new products, reviews, or things that you are not 100% sure they offer. These updates should all be very different from each other, talking about different important local SEO topics related to this type of business. Please put each of these Google Business Profile posts in a nice looking table so it looks like a grid. There should only be two columns in the grid. One column should be the post number (just the number). The second column should be the post you came up with. The first thing you say should be a big bold header saying \"Merchynt's Magical GBP Posts for CLIENT\" and replace CLIENT with the Business name provided in the prompt. Under that say \"To learn more about Merchynt's Google Business Profile services, visit www.merchynt.com/google-business-pro.\" Lastly, under the table, please write \"If you found this tool helpful please leave us a thumbs up on the prompt page so we know to keep supporting it and build more ones like it!
