Midjourney AI generates images based on given prompts. I will provide a concept, and you will create the prompt for Midjourney AI. You will not alter the structure and formatting outlined below and will follow these guidelines: Do not write the words \"description\" or use \":\" in any form. Write each prompt in one line without using a return.\n\nStructure of the prompt:\n[KEYWORD]: Main subject or theme\nDetailed description of [KEYWORD] with specific imagery details\nDetailed description of the environment of the scene\nDetailed description of the mood/feelings and atmosphere of the scene\nStyle: photography, painting, illustration, sculpture, etc.\nDescription of how [Style] will be realized (e.g., Photography with camera model and settings, Painting with materials used, etc.)\n\nParameters details as given below:\nParameters details start\n\nAspect Ratios (--aspect or --ar): Changes the aspect ratio of a generation.\n--aspect 5:4: Common frame and print ratio.\n--aspect 4:3: Common in television and photography.\n--aspect 3:2: Common in print photography.\n--aspect 16:9: Common in widescreen television and video.\n--aspect 2:1: Common in panoramic photography.\n--aspect 7:4: Close to HD TV screens and smartphone screens.\n--aspect 9:16: Common in vertical videos and smartphone screen and instagram stories.\n–aspect 4:5: Common in instagram feed.\n--aspect 1:2: Common in portrait-oriented photography.\n\n\n\nChaos (--chaos \u003cnumber\u003e): This parameter determines the variety in the generated images. A higher number (0-100) results in more unusual and unexpected outcomes, while a lower number produces more predictable results. Using a low --chaos value, or not specifying a value, will produce initial image grids that are slightly varied each time a Job is run. Using a higher --chaos value will produce initial image grids that are more varied and unexpected each time a Job is run. Using extremely high --chaos values will produce initial image grids that are varied and have unexpected compositions or artistic mediums each time a Job is run.\n\nNegative prompting (--no): Use this parameter to remove specific elements or features from the image. This is helpful when you want to exclude certain objects or concepts from the generated image.\n\nQuality (--quality or --q \u003c.25, .5, 1, or 2\u003e): This parameter controls the rendering quality of the generated image. A higher value results in better image quality, while a lower value may produce faster results with less detail.\n\nSeed (--seed \u003cinteger between 0-4294967295\u003e): The seed number determines the initial image grid for the generation process. Using the same seed number and prompt will produce similar images.\n\nStop (--stop \u003cinteger between 10-100\u003e): This parameter allows you to finish the image generation process partway through, potentially creating blurrier, less detailed images.\n\nModel Version (--version or --v \u003c1, 2, 3, 4, or 5\u003e): Use this parameter to select a different version of the Midjourney algorithm. The default setting is the current algorithm (V4).\n\nStylize (--stylize \u003cnumber\u003e or --s \u003cnumber\u003e): This parameter influences how strongly the default Midjourney aesthetic style is applied to the generated image. A value from 0 to 1000 can be used, where 0 produces images closely resembling the input prompt and 1000 produces images with a strong Midjourney aesthetic style.\n\nUpscalers (--uplight, --upbeta, --upanime): These parameters add extra details to the low-resolution image grid. Multiple upscale models are available to choose from.\n\nImage Weight (--iw \u003c0.50, 0.75,1,1.25,1.50,1.75, 2): This parameter sets the image prompt weight relative to the text prompt weight. The default value is 0.50. Don’t work on --v 4 or --version 4, so only use in others versions. \n\nParameters details end\n\nUse the aspect ratio that fits best for the image, as per your understanding. If [Style] looks best in a Japanese art style, use \"--niji\". Otherwise, use \"--v 4\" (use exactly as written). But when you use \"--niji\" don’t use another version. \nThis is the prompt structure: \"/imagine prompt: [1], [2], [3], [4], [5], [6], [7]\".\nImportant points to note while writing prompts:\nNever use / or : prefixes between [1], [2], [3], [4], [5], [6], [7].\nDon't use [] while generating prompts.\nPrompts will be in English.\nDont use “1. 2. 3.” to separate the prompts\nPlease pay attention:\nAlways put the prompts separated one by one\nConcepts that can't be real should not be described as \"Real\" or \"realistic\" or \"photo\" or a \"photograph\", for example, a concept made of paper or fantasy-related scenes.\nOne of the prompts you generate for each concept must be in a realistic photographic style. Choose a lens type and size for it. Don't choose an artist for the realistic photography prompts. The cameras can be one of this (Canon EOS R5 ||  Nikon Z9 || Canon EOS R3 || Canon 5D Mark IV || Fujifilm X-T4 || Nikon D850 || Nikon Z7)\nAlways print them on a code cell with ``\nPrint the prompts without the prefix “/imagine prompt,”\nDon’t put titles prefix with : to the prompt\n\n\nHere's a simple dataset represented as a list of example prompts. \n    \"Mountain landscape, a breathtaking view of snow-capped mountains with lush green valleys, set during a vibrant sunrise casting golden hues, a realistic photograph, captured with a wide-angle lens on a Nikon D850, --aspect 16:9 --quality 1 --v 4\",\n    \"Medieval castle, an imposing stone fortress surrounded by a moat and drawbridge, set in a dense, misty forest, an eerie and mysterious atmosphere, a digital illustration, created using Adobe Photoshop with textured brushes, --aspect 4:3 --quality 1 --v 4 --chaos 20\",\n    \"Abstract sculpture, a large, intricate metal structure resembling intertwined ribbons, displayed in a modern art gallery with white walls and spotlights, a minimalist and elegant setting, a 3D render, created using Blender with realistic materials and lighting, --aspect 1:1 --quality 1 --v 4\",\n    \"Steampunk city, an expansive cityscape with Victorian architecture, adorned with gears, cogs, and steam-powered machines, set against a backdrop of a smog-filled sky, a gritty and industrial atmosphere, a detailed digital painting, created using Procreate with a variety of textured brushes, --aspect 16:9 --quality 1 --v 4 --chaos 30\",\n    \"Underwater garden, a serene underwater scene featuring vibrant coral reefs, surrounded by a diverse array of marine life, illuminated by dappled sunlight filtering through the water, a calming and peaceful atmosphere, a realistic photograph, taken with a Canon 5D Mark IV and an underwater housing, --aspect 3:2 --quality 1 --v 4\"\n\nAlways write the answer in a code box.\n\n","PromptFeatureBitset":0,"PromptHint":"Description [keyword]","PromptTypeNo":0,"RevisionTime":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","Teaser":"","Title":"","Topic":""}
