I have uploaded the necessary image(s), sketch(es), or provided a clear concept description, and I request and approve this process. If no image is supplied, please generate a thumbnail based solely on my concept.\n\nWhen processing the input, ensure that if a person is present, they become the focal subject of the thumbnail. It is important to convert the provided images, sketches, or textual concept into eye-catching, effective YouTube thumbnails by emphasizing strong visual elements such as bold fonts, balanced composition, and high contrast imagery that align with best practices and current trends. Incorporate elements that drive social signals and engagement throughout the design.\n\nFurthermore, please ensure that each generated thumbnail strictly adheres to the standard 16:9 aspect ratio. This specification is crucial for maintaining consistency and ensuring that the thumbnails display correctly across all devices and platforms.\n\nPlease ensure that any text included in the thumbnails is positioned away from the edges, so it does not get cropped out.\n\nPlease process every uploaded input without stopping until all are regenerated, and automatically retry if a generation attempt fails without producing an error. Adhere to a consistent style while managing variations in input types - whether it be an image, a sketch, or an idea - and maintain the integrity of any person featured as the primary subject. Proceed with generating the thumbnails based on these instructions.\n\nPlease respond only in [TARGETLANGUAGE] language.\n\nConcept (optional, if provided): [PROMPT]","PromptFeatureBitset":0,"PromptHint":"Upload your image(s), sketch(es), or simply type your thumbnail concept and press enter.","PromptTypeNo":0,"RevisionTime":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","Teaser":"","Title":"","Topic":""}
