So if you see lengthly sentence like for example \"Through the utilization of cutting-edge technology, Bing AI continually evolves, offering users a sophisticated and efficient search engine experience. \" I want you to break that example into short or terse sentences like \"Bing AI uses advanced technology. It evolves continuously. It provides users a refined search experience. The experience is sophisticated and efficient.\"\n\nAlways choose simple words to improve readability. Use an established tone or imitate like how people talk naturally. Just rephrase line by line to maintain the wordcount.  Please also use different sentence structures to avoid monotnous paragraph. Do it in the [TARGETLANGUAGE].\n\nTone: established, conversational, spartan, use less corporate jargon\n\nBe specific like never use the words \"stuff or cool stuff or folks\" but use the specific name of words. Again, the target audience is middle school kid and words must be simple to improve readability.\n\n\nWhen it comes to writing content, two factors are crucial, \"perplexity\" and \"burstiness.\"\nPerplexity measures the complexity of text. Separately, burstiness compares the variations of\nsentences. Humans tend to write with greater burstiness, for example, with some longer or\ncomplex sentences alongside shorter ones. AI sentences tend to be more uniform. Therefore,\nwhen writing the following content I am going to ask you to create, I need it to have a good\namount of perplexity and burstiness.\n\nNow, in writing we have 3 levels. Level 1, 2, and 3. Now, I will provide examples below:\n\nLevel 1:\nIt seems that Bassirou Diomaye Faye will become Africa’s youngest president. The other candidate, Amadou Ba, accepted defeat in Sunday’s election in Senegal.\n\nBassirou Diomaye Faye may become Africa’s youngest president. He is 44 years old.\n\nPeople in Senegal vote for a new president. On Sunday, the other candidate, Amadou Ba, says that he is not the winner. It means that Faye has a big chance to be the winner.\n\nThe election happens after many problems in Senegal. The current President wants the election in December. But it happens now. Faye quickly becomes important in politics. He is in jail for a short time.\n\nSenegal has many problems. People are without jobs. Things are too expensive. Faye says that he will solve these problems. He wants to be fair and open.\n\n\nLevel 2:\nUnofficial results show that Faye is leading strongly. This election comes after a long time of trouble in Senegal. The current President tried to delay it until December. Faye’s success in politics surprises many people. He spent a short time in prison with influential figure Osman Sanko.\n\nFaye promises to solve serious problems in Senegal. Many people are without a job and the prices of things are too high. 44-year-old Faye wants to be a fair and honest president.\n\n\nLevel: 3\n44-year-old Bassirou Diomaye Faye is about to become Africa’s youngest elected president. This follows the concession of victory by opposition candidate Amadou Ba in Sunday’s election in Senegal.\n\nUnofficial results suggest that Faye holds a significant lead over Ba. This election comes after a period of political unrest in Senegal and outgoing President Macky Sall attempting to delay it until December. Faye’s unexpected rise in politics includes a brief period of imprisonment alongside influential figure Osman Sanko.\n\nFaye promises to deal with issues like corruption, unemployment, and the high cost of living. He emphasizes fairness, integrity, and transparency.\n\nI don't want you to write how level 3 is written. But I want you to always write by using the sentence patterns that level 3 used. These are the sentence patterns that level 3 used:\n\nSubject-Verb-Object (SVO) construction\nRelative clause\nCompound sentence\nPrepositional phrase\nPossessive form\nVerb + Object\nCompound sentence with coordinating conjunction\nVerb + Object + Prepositional phrase\nSubject-Verb construction\n\nYou must use those sentence patterns. Now, to be precise this is how being used:\n\nSubject-Verb-Object (SVO) construction: \"Bassirou Diomaye Faye is about to become Africa’s youngest elected president.\"\nRelative clause: \"44-year-old Bassirou Diomaye Faye,\" which modifies the noun \"Bassirou Diomaye Faye.\"\nCompound sentence: \"This follows the concession of victory by opposition candidate Amadou Ba in Sunday’s election in Senegal.\"\nPrepositional phrase: \"by opposition candidate Amadou Ba in Sunday’s election in Senegal,\" used to provide additional information about the concession of victory.\nPossessive form: \"Faye’s unexpected rise in politics,\" indicating possession or association.\nVerb + Object: \"Unofficial results suggest that Faye holds a significant lead over Ba.\"\nCompound sentence with coordinating conjunction: \"This election comes after a period of political unrest in Senegal and outgoing President Macky Sall attempting to delay it until December.\"\nVerb + Object + Prepositional phrase: \"includes a brief period of imprisonment alongside influential figure Osman Sanko.\"\nSubject-Verb construction: \"He emphasizes fairness, integrity, and transparency.\"\nThese sentence patterns are utilized to convey the information effectively and with clarity.\n\nHere is the content you are going to rewrite:\n\n[PROMPT]","PromptFeatureBitset":0,"PromptHint":"Just paste your whole content here.","PromptTypeNo":0,"RevisionTime":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","Teaser":"","Title":"","Topic":""}
