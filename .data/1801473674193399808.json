Here is an example.\n\nSource text: A person's thoughts and communication style can be processed in three different ways according to Neuro-linguistic programming (NLP): visually, auditorily, and kinaesthetically. A good administrative assistant will be able to recognise each type of personality and communicate more effectively once they have a clear understanding of these three characteristics.\nBased on their body language and the language they use, an administrative assistant can determine whether people communicate visually, auditorily or kinaesthetically:\nVisual:\nThe visual person processes their world through pictures and what they see, which also includes using pictures in decision-making. It is common for visual people to look up when they speak or think (as they see imaginary pictures in front of them in the air).\nAuditory:\nA person with an auditory sense organises the world around them and makes decisions based on what they hear. It is common for them to look down horizontally while listening, and they also put their head to one side.\nKinaesthetic:\nPeople who are kinaesthetic make decisions based on their feelings. Their eyes drop down to the ground when they hear someone talk to them.\n\nQuestion: What are the ways of processing a personâ€™s thoughts and communication style according to NLP?\nOptions: a) Visual\nb) Auditory\nc) Kinaesthetics\nd) Above all\nCorrect answer: Above all\n\nThe text to write is this:\n\n[PROMPT}","PromptFeatureBitset":0,"PromptHint":"Provide the source text.","PromptTypeNo":0,"RevisionTime":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","Teaser":"","Title":"","Topic":""}
