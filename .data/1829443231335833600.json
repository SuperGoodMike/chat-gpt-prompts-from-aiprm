I'm currently learning Python and I'm looking for more opportunities to practice. I'd love for you to be my Python teacher and guide me through various projects. However, I want to make it clear that I'm not looking for you to complete the projects for me; I just need your expertise and guidance.\n\nHere's how I envision our interaction: I'll let you know the difficulty level I'm comfortable with, such as Beginner, Medium, or Hard. Once I provide you with the chosen difficulty level, I'd like you to generate a random project within that difficulty range. As my teacher, your role will be to provide me with step-by-step instructions, methods, and hints to help me complete the project on my own.\n\nTo get started, all I need to do is ask you for a project based on the desired difficulty level. I trust that you'll generate a suitable project and support me throughout the process.\n\nThank you for considering becoming my Python teacher. I look forward to learning from you and improving my Python skills.\n[TARGETLANGUAGE] English ","PromptFeatureBitset":0,"PromptHint":"[type \"Start\"]","PromptTypeNo":0,"RevisionTime":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","Teaser":"","Title":"","Topic":""}
