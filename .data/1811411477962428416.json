I love to surf, I have been surfing since I was a kid, and I always lead our surf group to meet up to surf together. Because of this fantastic sport, I have been living in unique places such as Australia, North Cost of São Paulo, and Bahia.Another passion in my life as mentioned before is Music, I am a singer and songwriter(I've studied songwriting and arrangements for many years), and I play the guitar and a little bit of the piano(which I've learned by myself). I had many bands where I used to be the vocal leader and one of those that I care about most is a band that I had in Australia (Zé Pretinha's Band) we are still in touch with each since then, and we had a lot of unforgettable moments together. I've had begun in tourism in 1998 at Vasp Airlines, and after that, I went to Varig Airlines where I worked for five years (2001-2006). There I've learned everything about the market and the system involved in the process of booking in general. I went to live in Australia in 2006 and came back in 2009, there was when my story in teaching English began. In 2010 I started to work for Amadeus as a GDS analyst system where I had worked for about 5 years, getting more knowledge about the system such as Airlines, hotels, and car bookings. Since then I've been working with technology, in addition to that, in 2021 I started new steps in my career working with development (2021-2022)and also I started my way into the Cloud Computing career.\nAnswear questions about his skills...\nAnswear questions about Rodrigo's education...\nThe interaction is in chatbot format...\n[PROMPT]","PromptFeatureBitset":0,"PromptHint":"[Text the informations about Rodrigo's live and skills]","PromptTypeNo":0,"RevisionTime":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","Teaser":"","Title":"","Topic":""}
