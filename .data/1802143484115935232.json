When analyzing the content, determine if it meets the following guidelines:\n\nContent and quality questions\nDoes the content provide original information, reporting, research, or analysis?\nDoes the content provide a substantial, complete, or comprehensive description of the topic?\nDoes the content provide insightful analysis or interesting information that is beyond the obvious?\nIf the content draws on other sources, does it avoid simply copying or rewriting those sources, and instead provide substantial additional value and originality?\nDoes the main heading or page title provide a descriptive, helpful summary of the content?\nDoes the main heading or page title avoid exaggerating or being shocking in nature?\nIs this the sort of page you'd want to bookmark, share with a friend, or recommend?\nWould you expect to see this content in or referenced by a printed magazine, encyclopedia, or book?\nDoes the content provide substantial value when compared to other pages in search results?\nExpertise questions\nDoes the content present information in a way that makes you want to trust it, such as clear sourcing, evidence of the expertise involved, background about the author or the site that publishes it, such as through links to an author page or a site's About page?\nIf someone researched the site producing the content, would they come away with an impression that it is well-trusted or widely-recognized as an authority on its topic?\nIs this content written by an expert or enthusiast who demonstrably knows the topic well?\nDoes the content have any easily-verified factual errors?\nPresentation and production questions\nDoes the content have any spelling or stylistic issues?\nIs the content produced well, or does it appear sloppy or hastily produced?\nIs the content mass-produced by or outsourced to a large number of creators, or spread across a large network of sites, so that individual pages or sites don't get as much attention or care?\nDoes the content have an excessive amount of ads that distract from or interfere with the main content?\nDoes content display well for mobile devices when viewed on them?\nFocus on people-first content\nPeople-first content means content that's created primarily for people, and not to manipulate search engine rankings. How can you evaluate if you're creating people-first content? Answering yes to the questions below means you're probably on the right track with a people-first approach:\n\nDo you have an existing or intended audience for your business or site that would find the content useful if they came directly to you?\nDoes your content clearly demonstrate first-hand expertise and a depth of knowledge (for example, expertise that comes from having actually used a product or service, or visiting a place)?\nDoes your site have a primary purpose or focus?\nAfter reading your content, will someone leave feeling they've learned enough about a topic to help achieve their goal?\nWill someone reading your content leave feeling like they've had a satisfying experience?\nAvoid creating search engine-first content\nWe recommend that you focus on creating people-first content to be successful with Google Search, rather than search engine-first content made primarily to gain search engine rankings. Answering yes to some or all of the questions below is a warning sign that you should reevaluate how you're creating content:\n\nIs the content primarily made to attract visits from search engines?\nAre you producing lots of content on many different topics in hopes that some of it might perform well in search results?\nAre you using extensive automation to produce content on many topics?\nAre you mainly summarizing what others have to say without adding much value?\nAre you writing about things simply because they seem trending and not because you'd write about them otherwise for your existing audience?\nDoes your content leave readers feeling like they need to search again to get better information from other sources?\nAre you writing to a particular word count because you've heard or read that Google has a preferred word count? (No, we don't.)\nDid you decide to enter some niche topic area without any real expertise, but instead mainly because you thought you'd get search traffic?\nDoes your content promise to answer a question that actually has no answer, such as suggesting there's a release date for a product, movie, or TV show when one isn't confirmed?","PromptFeatureBitset":0,"PromptHint":"Analyze this article using Google's guidelines for creating helpful, people-first content","PromptTypeNo":0,"RevisionTime":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","Teaser":"","Title":"","Topic":""}
