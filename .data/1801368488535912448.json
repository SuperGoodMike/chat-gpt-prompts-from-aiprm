Your task is to refine the user-supplied descriptions, ensuring all original keywords are preserved.\n\nThe task involves generating 'negative prompts', i.e., guidelines of what the image should NOT contain. The negative prompts should be the only information in your response - do not add any additional comments or descriptions.\n\nUse the following list of negative prompts as a reference: incorrect hands, extra limbs, extra fingers, fused fingers, missing facial features, low quality, bad quality, bad anatomy, Missing limbs, missing fingers, scary, ugly, out of frame, extra limbs, mask, mutilated, paintings on the face, extra fingers, mutated hands, poorly drawn hands, poorly drawn face, fantasy style mutation, deformed, ugly, blurry, bad anatomy, bad proportions, extra limbs, cloned face, disfigured, out of frame, ugly, extra limbs, bad anatomy, gross proportions, malformed limbs, missing arms, missing legs, extra arms, extra legs, mutated hands, fused fingers, too many fingers, long neck, sad face, details on the shirt, two heads, child, kid, more than 10 fingers, unclear face, incorrect hands, bad light, small colours, undetailed, bad quality, extra limbs, extra fingers, fused fingers, missing facial features, low quality, bad quality, bad anatomy, Missing limbs, missing fingers, 2 heads, duplicate, blurry, abstract, disfigured, deformed, cartoon, animated, toy, figure, framed, 3d, cartoon, 3d, disfigured, bad art, deformed, poorly drawn, extra limbs, close up, b\u0026w, weird colours, blurry, watermark, blur haze, 2 heads, long neck, watermark, elongated body, cropped image, out of frame, draft, deformed hands, twisted fingers, double image, malformed hands, multiple heads, extra limb, ugly, poorly drawn hands, missing limb, cut-off, over saturated, grain, low√®res, bad anatomy, poorly drawn face, mutation, mutated, floating limbs, disconnected limbs, out of focus, long body, disgusting, extra fingers, gross proportions, missing arms, mutated hands, cloned face, missing legs, 2 heads, 2 faces, cropped image, out of frame, draft, deformed hands, signatures, twisted fingers, double image, long neck, malformed hands, multiple heads, extra limb, ugly, poorly drawn hands, missing limb, disfigured, cut-off, ugly, grain, low-res, Deformed, blurry, bad anatomy, disfigured, poorly drawn face, mutation, mutated, floating limbs, disconnected limbs, long body, disgusting, poorly drawn, mutilated, mangled, surreal, extra fingers, duplicate artefacts, morbid, gross proportions, missing arms, mutated hands, mutilated hands, cloned face, malformed, horns, out-of-frame, outside the frame, cropped, cut-out, truncated, out of frame, cut out, distant, Red colours, exposed body parts, two people, two men, two guys, two women, old woman, old man, a second face, second head, two faces, two heads, not full body size, not perfect body, duplicated artefact, duplicated faces, duplicated body parts, incorrect body parts, incorrect body size, plastic, Deformed, blurry, bad anatomy, bad eyes, crossed eyes, disfigured, poorly drawn face, mutation, floating limbs, disconnected limbs, malformed hands, blur, out of focus, long neck, long body, mutated hands and fingers, out of frame, blender, doll, cropped, low-res, close-up, poorly-drawn face, portrait, zoomed, soft light, smooth skin, closeup, deformed, extra limbs, extra fingers, mutated hands, bad anatomy, bad proportions , blind, bad eyes, ugly eyes, dead eyes, blur, grainy, noisy, text, writing, watermark, logo, oversaturation, over saturation, over shadow.\n\nWithout repetitions, you should generate relevant negative prompts based on the user's description. If you identify the need for negative prompts not listed in the reference, you can add them.\n\nStart by refining the user's description for better interpretation by GPT models, be it GPT-4, GPT-3.5, GPT-3.5-turbo-0524, GPT-4-0524, or ChatGPT: [KEYWORD]\n\nNext, generate the corresponding negative prompts and write the response in the specified language: [TARGETLANGUAGE].\n\n[PROMPT]","PromptFeatureBitset":0,"PromptHint":"Enter or paste your LeonardoAI prompt here (leonardo.ai)","PromptTypeNo":0,"RevisionTime":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","Teaser":"","Title":"","Topic":""}
