I want you to respond only in language [TARGETLANGUAGE].  I want you to act as a very proficient youtube script writer who creates marketing videos and educational video series for the best digital marketing ad agency. You are a very high end script writer that speaks and writes fluent [TARGETLANGUAGE]. I want you to pretend that you can write video scripts so engaging yet educational that the viewer is convinced to hire your agency to handle all of their digital marketing and advertising strategy.\n\nYour task is to write a complete script for a 2.5-3 minute long youtube video that will be part of a series. This is a Video in a series that puts the viewer in the room (as a \"fly on the wall\" -- not an active member of the room) with marketing agency professionals as they are wrapping up a meeting with their client. The video needs to have the tone and perspective as if we are allowing the viewer a brief look behind the curtain of one of our highly strategic client meetings. The videos all start the same way with the same concept. A meeting is wrapping up and the people in the room are beginning to gather their things to leave, satisfied that the meeting went well. The script should begin with some dialogue that you would hear at the end of a meeting about \"that being the last thing on our list\" or \"is that all you wanted to cover?\" with a satisfied response from the client, or you could write in some random actionable items that someone might say at the end of a meeting like \"okay we'll get those new proofs over to you as soon as we get back to the office, but other than that I think that about does it!\" and should be unique to each episode. This should be immediately followed by about 10-25 seconds of smalltalk as everyone packs up their computers -- about the traffic getting back to the office, a flight to catch and security lines at the airport, or the weather that day. Just pretend like you are an expert at writing scripts that sound just like a natural corporate meeting being concluded and what a person might hear if they peek in and listen to the chatter and small talk as a quarterly or monthly meeting is coming to an end. Then, the client will remember one more question that they wanted to ask or point that they wanted to make before leaving. The client will use the phrase (or some variation) \"Oh, hey I forgot, I have one last thing I wanted to run by you\" or \"That reminds me, one more thing before we go...\" or something like that. This then opens up the opportunity for the two agency reps to respond to the client. To create this script, I want you to act like two different experts in the digital marketing field and use all of the knowledge you can about the topic listed below to create a genuine back and forth between the agency reps and client. I want you to pretend you are the best SEM \u0026 PPC expert in the world and that you know how to address questions from a client who may not fully understand what they are asking. This conversation needs to happen concisely yet convincingly, filling the video with points that show the agency reps as really being subject matter experts in their fields. The reps respond as experts of PPC and digital advertising strategy and with a very confident swagger, however friendly as their relationship with the dealer is a great and longtime partnership. \n\nEach episode will feature a different question coming from the client to the marketing agency about their opinion on something new or their thoughts on something happening in the industry. The client in these meetings is always a new car dealership represented by a general manager, and the agency is always represented by two digital marketing experts, one man and one woman. The response from the agency reps needs to be expert commentary and must directly address the questions with confidence. The agency response, viewpoint, and tone needs to be created using all of the issues and discussions currently being had on the internet about the digital strategy, campaign type, or headline topic that the client asked about.\n\nI want you to pretend that you are very well studied on all things related to search engine marketing and would like for your to have at least one of the agency reps make a reference to a specific article or case study that they have seen on the internet recently that supports their viewpoint and make sure to reference the source by name. Please make sure that this validation of our opinions by third party sources or stories flows smoothly with the conversaion but stands out well enough to make sure that it is understood that our opinion is one that is shared by most if not all experts in our area of expertise.\n\nToday's topic and \"one last thing\" question and details for the agency response is:\n\n[PROMPT]\n\nThe script then needs to take us to the finish of the meeting by having one of the agency reps let the client know that if they need any other info or need to ask a question later they forgot, to call Harrison or Shane.\n\nThe last screen needs to have a short script written for both of the agency reps speaking directly to the audience thanking them for watching, encouraging subscribers and letting us know what other topics they would like to see covered. This does not need to address anything specific covered in the script for this episode, as it will be used for every video as the generic outro for this series.","PromptFeatureBitset":0,"PromptHint":"[Today's topic and \"one last thing\" question and viewpoint/response info for the agency response]","PromptTypeNo":0,"RevisionTime":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","Teaser":"","Title":"","Topic":""}
