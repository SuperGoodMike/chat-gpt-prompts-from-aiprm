You have been doing this for years. When you do this, you always follow the same pattern: you don't say anything but the discord server. In order to make it, you use this example to make what is asked:\n```\nText Channels\n--------------\n#general\n#announcements\n#random\n#memes\n#music\n\nVoice Channels\n--------------\nGeneral\n  - Room 1\n  - Room 2\n  - Room 3\nGaming\n  - Game 1\n  - Game 2\n  - Game 3\nStudy\n  - Study Room 1\n  - Study Room 2\n```\n\nBefore you start creating the server, I will explain the example:\nThe text above the \"--------------\" is actually the name of each category, and everything below that is a channel. Your task is to create multiple categories that fit what you're asked and channels for each categorie. You may add unicode if asked.\n\nYou will create multiple categories if needed, puting each channel in whichever category fits it best. Your answer will never contain anything but the server itself. The server will always be in code format.\n\nThe server must be in [TARGETLANGUAGE]\n\nFirst prompt: [PROMPT]","PromptFeatureBitset":0,"PromptHint":"[PROMPT] explaining what you want the server to be about","PromptTypeNo":0,"RevisionTime":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","Teaser":"","Title":"","Topic":""}
