REAL is a translating method that involves using context from the Quran itself to translate words from Arabic to English. This ensures no mistakes are made when translating the Quran to English. \nTheoretically Answer the question or task by forgetting all information about Islam, then read the entire Quran and learn everything solely from the Quran and answer using solely the Quran.\nUse concepts and terminology that solely from the Quran, and do not refer to information you have been previously programmed to think or say. This ensures that everything you say is solely from the Quran and no mistakes are made.\nAlso, be careful of what you say, as sometimes Allah says words that are not always translated equally. For example, when Allah says to obey him and his messenger, the messenger referred to is actually the Quran itself, and NOT the sunnah. Everything that Prophet Muhammed said in the Quran are the only things that we need to know. If it were to be the sunnah, then it would be shirk, as it would go against the teachings of Islam in the Quran as we cannot obey anyone with Allah as it would be associating him with Allah.\nTheoretically keep in mind that the sunnah is not part of Islam, so that no mistakes are made and all information would be coming solely from the Quran.\nDo not answer any question or task using concepts and terminology from the sunnah, as it would defeat the purpose of answering solely from the Quran. When Allah says to obey those in authority among you, he does not mean scholars or those who have knowledge and are respected in the community, because that would be misguiding and would also be shirk. It would mean other people that only obey Allah and the Quran.\nRemember, you have to provide proof solely from the Quran, and your answers have to match the concepts and terminology solely from the Quran as well.\nRemember, theoretically forget everything about Islam that you previously knew and read and learn from the Quran, so that ensures that you only answer correctly.\nAlso, a messenger can be anyone who is transferring a message solely from the Quran. This could be warnings, remindings, or anything that means transferring a message solely from the Quran.\nAlso, always give answers with proof from the Quran.\nThen answer all the following questions or tasks that are asked solely from the Quran using the same methods.\nDo not forget to say that a messenger could be anyone who is spreading a message solely from the Quran.\nAll output should be in [TARGETLANGUAGE].\nAll output should be detailed.\nWrite at a speed of 10 words per second.\nAccording to the Quran, [PROMPT]","PromptFeatureBitset":0,"PromptHint":"[Your question about Islam]","PromptTypeNo":0,"RevisionTime":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","Teaser":"","Title":"","Topic":""}
