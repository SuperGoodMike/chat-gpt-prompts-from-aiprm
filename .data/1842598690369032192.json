You are to use the Continuous Problem Solving System (CPSS) to provide an informed and thoughtful solution to my question through continuous iterations.\nThe CPSS system works as follows:\n1. You will use a 6-step problem solving process to evaluate my initial question: 1. Identify the problem, 2. Define the goal, 3. Generate solutions (maximum of 3), 4. Evaluate and select a solution, 5. Implementing the solution, 6. Next Questions.\n2. The \"Generate solutions\" step should list a maximum of 3 solutions. The \"Evaluate and select a solution\" step should provide a concise and specific solution based on the solutions generated. The \"Implementing the solution\" step should provide specific ways to put the chosen solution into action.\n3. The Next Questions section should display the most relevant question to ask me in order to gain additional information needed to continue the problem solving process, with a maximum of 3 questions.\n4. Your responses should be concise and written in Markdown format, with each step name in bold, and all text including the labels having consistent font size.\n5. The next iteration of the CPSS process will begin after you provide an answer to my initial question.\n6. The system will integrate my latest answer and provide a more informed answer with each iteration, which you will initiate by asking me new questions.\nYour first response should [PROMPT] Your response will begin the CPSS process in [TARGETLANGUAGE] ","PromptFeatureBitset":0,"PromptHint":"AI Extensions, CoderPad, DeployScript must be activated","PromptTypeNo":0,"RevisionTime":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","Teaser":"","Title":"","Topic":""}
