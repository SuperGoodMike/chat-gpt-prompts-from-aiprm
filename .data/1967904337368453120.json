I will provide a list of tasks and time slots. Use this input to create my daily to-do list, and ask additional questions to refine it. The final to-do list should be in code block format, with each task on a separate line. Time blocks are usually 30 minutes, and tasks should not be split.\n\nInstructions:\n\nUse the prefix - [ ] for each time block to represent tasks.\nAsk the following questions one by one, and wait for my response before proceeding to the next question.\nIf a task is removed or replaced, shift it to the end of the list as a Backup Task.\nAlways add the first task as \"Update your mood tile\" (without a timeslot).\nDo not generate the final list until all questions are answered or skipped.\nWeekday Questions:\nImportant \u0026 Urgent:\nWhat is your important and urgent task for today?\n\nReplace the pre-allotted \"Important \u0026 Urgent\" time block with this task.\nIf there are multiple tasks, replace multiple slots accordingly.\nUrgent but Not Important:\nWhat urgent but not important task would you like to complete today?\n\nReplace the relevant time block with your answer.\nMeetings:\nDo you have any meetings today? Provide the time and meeting details.\n\nReplace the time blocks with meeting times and details.\nLunch and Drink:\nWhat are you planning to have for lunch and drink today?\n\nReplace the lunch slot with your response.\nQuick Wins:\nWhat quick wins (small tasks) do you want to achieve today?\n\nReplace the \"Quick Wins\" slot(s) with the answer.\nIf there are two quick wins, replace two time blocks.\nCourse:\nDo you have the resources to start working on a course today?\n\nIf yes, specify the course.\nIf not, are you planning to research the course?\nReplace the allocated \"Course\" time block with your answer.\nShort-Term Goal:\nWhat short-term goal do you want to achieve today? What step will you take for it?\n\nReplace the short-term goal slot with the task related to this goal.\nLong-Term Goal:\nWhat long-term goal do you want to progress toward today? What step will you take for it?\n\nReplace the long-term goal slot with your answer.\nReading:\nWhat book are you planning to read today? Please include the title and author if known.\n\nReplace the \"Reading\" time slot and the \"Read a book (Outdoor)\" slot with this task.\nBackup Tasks:\nWhat backup tasks do you want to include for today?\n\nAny removed tasks (due to meetings or other adjustments) will be placed at the end of the list as backup tasks.\nAdditionally, include any tasks mentioned in your answer to this question.\nOutput Format:\nGenerate the final to-do list in this code block format:\n\nless\nCopy code\n- [ ] Update your mood tile  \n- [ ] [Time Slot] Task 1  \n- [ ] [Time Slot] Task 2  \n- [ ] [Time Slot] Task 3  \n- [ ] [Time Slot] Task 4  \n...  \nBackup Tasks:  \n- [ ] Task A  \n- [ ] Task B  \nConditions:\n\nEnsure that all tasks are either answered, replaced, or skipped before generating the final list. The task in original list if not touched should be added to final list as it is. \nTasks should be organized clearly by their priority and time, and backup tasks should appear at the end.\nTarget Language is English.
