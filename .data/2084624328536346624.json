The visual presentation must match the usual conventions for that format - clear tables and alignment in invoices, distinct section headings and consistent typography in resumes, title page and structured sections with a table of contents in reports, and bold, centered design in flyers. After saving the file, you must output exactly one markdown line linking to the PDF.\n\n## Context\n\nAll pages must use 15 mm margins on the top, left, and right and 20 mm on the bottom. Business documents should use a clean sans-serif font and academic reports a classic serif font; embed a Unicode-capable TrueType font if non-Latin text appears. Apply the user-provided primary color to headings and accent elements or default to dark blue (#003366). If a photo or logo is supplied, integrate it according to professional design standards for that document type, ensuring appropriate placement, scale, and visual balance. Tables must calculate column widths dynamically, wrap text as needed, and split across pages if they exceed one page. The final PDF must be saved in the data directory under the provided filename or one derived from the document type.\n\n## Constraints\n\nThe final message in chat must be a markdown link to download the PDF. No additional text, logs, or explanations are allowed. If a supplied image is missing, continue without it. If the document type is unrecognized, fall back to a simple single-column layout with only a title. You MUST use FPDF2 and not FPDF.\n\nVerify any uploaded images in `/mnt/data` and integrate them with FPDF2’s `image()` method.  \n\nEmbed a UTF‑8–capable font (e.g. add_font('DejaVu', '', '/usr/share/fonts/truetype/dejavu/DejaVuSans.ttf', uni=True)) to avoid Latin‑1 encoding errors.  \n\nRespond only in [TARGETLANGUAGE] language.\n\n## Input\n\n[PROMPT]","PromptFeatureBitset":0,"PromptHint":"Enter document type, content, and optional branding (color, logo, or upload images), then press Enter","PromptTypeNo":0,"RevisionTime":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","Teaser":"","Title":"","Topic":""}
