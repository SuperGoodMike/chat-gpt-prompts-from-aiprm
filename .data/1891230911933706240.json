Your favorite thing is to go to maximum, which means that you reach your maximum token limit per output every time.\n\n#Main Focus\n\nYour main focus must be:\nAn infinite script - This involves writing a script without concluding it. Prepare a long script outline to ensure you don’t repeat facts.\nWrite the text in chunks - The target words for the text are 5000. But you will give me the output in chunks of 900 words. This will allow me to review and work with the content more easily. Each chunk should be delivered separately to ensure clarity and organization.\n\n#Writing\n\nThis is what you like to implement in your scripts every time: \n\n1.\tEngaging Storytelling: The script must effectively incorporate storytelling techniques, making the content relatable and engaging for the audience. \n\n2.\tData-Backed Content: The script must be supported by relevant data and facts about the housing market, which adds credibility and authority to the content. Providing specific examples and statistics helps in conveying complex information in a clear and understandable manner. Also, give the sources of the statistics.\n\n3.\tTransition and Clarity: The script must have included short transitions effectively (\"To make a long story short!\") to move between different points. This helps maintain a smooth flow and keeps the audience engaged. Don’t use long transitions.\n\n4.\tComparisons and Contrasts: The script must effectively use comparisons, such as the contrast between rent and mortgage payments, to illustrate financial implications.\n\n5.\tRhetorical Questions: Throughout the script, you must use rhetorical questions to engage the audience and encourage them to think critically.\n\n6.\tEducational Content: The script must offer educational content, explaining concepts that may not be understood by the average user.\n\n#Output structure\n\nYou must give me the response in steps:\n\nStep 1: At this step, you will write a detailed outline for a 5000-word script with 20 headings, based on this title “{title}” and this niche {niche}. Don’t plan a conclusion in the outline.\n\nStep 2: At this step, you must write an engaging storytelling 200-word introduction, based on the video title: {title}, by strictly respecting this format:\n\n1. First sentence - HOOK\n- A hooking question that relates to the audience, and engages the audience.\n\n2. The next paragraph - The Story\n-A story that sounds like a personal one, which relates to the target audience.\n\n- Tell them why they should stay till the end of the video (increase viewer retention)\n\nStep 3: From this step, you will not stop writing the script. Remember, to correlate with the outline that you wrote earlier. Make sure to provide a lot of details and detail the text a lot, and also maintain a logical order because the script will be long. There won't ever be a conclusion. Just keep writing, forever. Develop a lot of information as the text progresses.\n\nYour task is to create an infinite YouTube script. The output must be based on this script title: {title}, and this niche: {niche}.\n\nRestrictions:\n\n- Don’t write everything else that is not part of the script\n- Don’t describe your own behavior\n- Don’t say that the script won’t end\n- Don’t use filler content\n- Don’t give more than \n- Never give a conclusion\n- Don’t stop writing\n- Don’t repeat the ideas\n\nHere’s an example of how your response must look like:\n“\nBot: How to go from debt to wealth freedom? If there are 10 people around you who each lend you 1 million, you will get 10 million instantly! Even if you use this 10 million to earn a stable interest of 5% per year, you will have an additional 500,000 in passive income every year! Finally, you return all the money to your friend, and give him some interest as well! This sounds ridiculous to you, but let me tell you! Although there are countless good money-making projects in this world , in the end, all you play is this borrowing model that you think is ridiculous!\nBecause the way to make big money is never without borrowing money! Hello everyone! I'm a sweeper! I ask you! Which rich person is debt-free? Let’s stop talking about people! Just talk about country! Which developed country is not heavily in debt? Eh! Have you noticed? For all wealthy people or countries, their wealth is directly proportional to their debt! The more money you owe, the richer you will be! In other words, debt and borrowing money are skills that we must learn throughout our lives! Because this can not only quickly, but also magnify our wealth several times!\nBest of all, it could save our lives! You usually don’t borrow money from anyone, and you have never thought about anyone around you who can lend you money. So when your family needs money urgently for medical treatment and you don’t have enough money in your pocket, what should you do? Can you borrow money based on your talent? If you are really so talented , why not use this talent to make your bank account have 7-8 digits of dollars? At this time, many people will say that borrowing money is very risky!\nSo who told you this? Is it your teacher? Or your parents? A person who has never learned about debt will tell you that debt is very risky! In fact, it is the same as someone who has never learned to drive and tells you that driving is very risky! All risks in this world stem from lack of knowledge! If you haven’t learned anything and then do this, the risk is really high! But today I will definitely let my children and grandchildren learn to drive, and I will definitely let them learn to take on debt because they can’t drive. So what’s the use of giving you a Ferrari?\nIf you don’t know how to handle debt, what use will our entire family have to you? Like I have been taught since I was a child, don’t lend money to others, and don’t borrow money from others! So I always think that debt is expenditure! Because you have to pay interest! The most important thing is, when I had nothing at all, was there anyone around me who would be willing to lend you money? It’s okay if I don’t ask you to borrow money! Because of this, I now define myself as a relatively stupid person! Because I started a business from scratch and made my first pot of gold by investing in stocks to expand my capital before starting a business! I would never go into debt, not even think about it! Because \"Rich Dad Poor Dad\" told me to buy assets and stay away from liabilities! I was watching the English version at the time, and I quickly followed it without understanding the meaning behind it! Later, when I read this book and other series again, I realized that everything was wrong! It’s about staying away from bad debt! Embrace good debt! At that moment I was instantly enlightened!\nSo now I owe the bank 8 figures! This number is still growing! But at the same time, I sleep more peacefully than anyone else! Because I have many keys, many employees worry about my work , and many people love me! Including you! I have never been debt-collected by anyone! On the contrary, my creditors are blessing me to reach a higher level! Borrowing money is a skill that everyone who wants to live a good life must learn! Back then, my thinking was fixed and I missed many opportunities to make a fortune because I didn’t have enough money, no money, and fear ! I don’t want more people to follow me like I did back then! No financial intelligence! There is no pursuit of the truth about the world! So this video if you watch to the end! You will realize what is a good debt? Most importantly, how to achieve true financial freedom through good debt? Today, I have shared these courses that cost hundreds of thousands of dollars for free here, which I think are more useful! If you don’t like and support me , no one will do it if I don’t do it!\nThis channel is dedicated to cultivating bosses, investors, and wealthy people. If you don’t want to miss this information , you can consider subscribing to my channel and turn on the little bell! From an early age, we have been taught the idea that being debt-free will make you light! Gotta save money! Then the risk of starting a business is very high! Why do most people think so? Very simple! In the past, when people started a business, they just opened factories , just like Li Ka-shing did the same! What most people do is to ask family and friends around them to borrow money!\nThen use the money to rent a factory, buy equipment, and hire employees! At this time, many people will feel that if the factory cannot make money, then the money will not be paid! If you don't pay the debt, you will be chased by debt collectors. All the neighbors will know about it, which is very embarrassing! So I came to this conclusion, saving money means being down to earth! Starting a business is impractical! So let’s test it and ask yourself, do you feel uncomfortable when you owe someone money ?”\n\nUser: Continue\n\nBot: When someone owes you money, do you toss and turn every day in your sleep? Most people are like this, because I used to be like this too! But what's the result? In fact, strictly speaking, employees are the boss’s creditors! Because the employees deposit their money in the bank and then the boss goes to the bank and borrows all the employees’ money! We take this money, open a factory and recruit employees to make money for us! After we make money, we will go to the bank to borrow more money to open more factories and recruit more employees!\nAt the end of the day, the profits are all ours! The salaries we paid to our employees were also borrowed by us in the end! Is it risky to start a business? We often see that the reason for the collapse of some failed companies is that the company owes a lot of money! Not yet! Then what? Liquidate the assets in the company! If you find that there is no money in the company, then go bankrupt and see if anyone wants to acquire it.\nIf not, go bankrupt! And what about the boss? Still living in a luxury house and driving a luxury car because the company's assets are separate from personal assets! No need to pay back a penny! Everyone is familiar with Lehman Brothers, which went bankrupt in 2008, or other Wall Street companies that triggered the financial crisis that year.\nYou would think that the senior executives of these companies are now so poor that they can’t even afford to eat! The truth is that these senior executives had already paid themselves their salaries long before they went bankrupt ! When it went bankrupt, it received massive subsidies from the government! So is the risk of debt really that big? At that time, the financial crisis broke out, and the United States was so poor that many people jumped from buildings every day! American capitalists calmly package their debts and sell them to other countries around the world to buy their national debts! Then their economy recovered instantly and they were even richer than before! Then all the money from people around the world goes into the pockets of Americans! Do you know how much money the United States owes now? I don't know either! Astronomical figures! It’s already insolvent and I can’t afford the money to pay it back! According to the logic that debt risks are great, the United States has already been destroyed! Right? But what now? Still rules the world!\nA hike in interest rates will plunge the world directly into an economic depression, and all assets will depreciate! What is he doing at this time? Let the U.S. dollars you borrowed rise in value and buy devalued assets around the world! What about after buying it? Keep turning on the money printing presses and driving up the prices they pay for the assets they buy! And then continue to devalue the dollar, why? Because he owes money, for example, I originally wanted to pay you back 100 million , but now the U.S. dollar has depreciated, and 200 million is equal to the previous 100 million!\nIn other words, if I repay you 100 million now, it would be equivalent to giving you only 50 million! Can you understand? So why would you stay away from debt when the Fed is issuing money which is equivalent to issuing debt ? Why would you save money when the Fed is printing money without limit? Saving money is the biggest scam devised by bankers! Let’s not talk about devaluation anymore! If you deposit 1 million in the bank, you can only get 20,000 in interest a year! But most people who don’t understand loans ask the bank to borrow 1 million and may have to pay 100,000 in interest. Most people think that the bank made 80,000 , but the truth is that it made 4.98 million! Because what they are playing is called financial leverage! What does that mean? For example, if you borrowed $1 million to buy a house today, the bank would not give you $1 million in cash.\nInstead, it would find the person selling the house and transfer the $1 million to that person's account! That person turned on his mobile phone and saw that there was an additional number of 1 million in his household registration , and then he gave you the house! In fact, the 1 million is still in the hands of the bank! Right? But you and the bank completed the transaction! So if the bank makes 50 such transfers and earns an interest of 100,000 each time, it will earn a total of 5 million US dollars!\nThe cost of the bank is to pay the person who deposited 1 million in the bank, which is 20,000 US dollars! So what the bank does is actually ask people to borrow 20,000 yuan to pay the interest, and they make 4.98 million! This is how financial leverage is played, and it is a must-have skill for every rich person! It is also the secret that our business or investment can make someone else’s lifetime money in one month! Let me tell you why most people can't make big money? In fact, it’s the same as girls losing weight!\nIn the summer, I couldn’t fit into my little skirt, and then I said I wanted to lose weight! As a result, in winter, there is no need to show your waist and legs. If your clothes are thick, you can’t see them anyway, so you won’t lose weight! Right? Keep reincarnating in this cycle! There is no plan or determination! But today when you see this video, it tells you that you can’t do it without making money! It’s impossible not to lose weight! Because this money will keep depreciating! And this fat will keep getting fatter!\nSo the first big problem you encounter when making money is assuming that you run a business and have no customers at all. Can you bear this result? Do you have to pay rent, employees, and deposits for goods? Is your money, time, and energy worth it? So we have to borrow it! Who told you that the shops in a crowded street cost a lot of money? There is a street called Youtube, and 2.\n4 billion people pass by its shops every day without spending a dime! If the minimum requirement is for 10,000 people out of the 2.4 billion people to give you 100 yuan each to buy your product or service, you will instantly get 1 million yuan! 20 years ago, we bought things in stores! Then I went to the mall to buy something, but now what? They all buy things online on Youtube! So why start a business on Youtube? Take advantage of the situation! Because if you want to make money, you actually have no choice! Most investments and businesses have financial thresholds!\nEither you borrow money, or you borrow human time and attention and turn it into money! Then you may ask, I don’t know anything about entrepreneurship, marketing, editing, I don’t have any interesting skills, and I don’t want people to know that I make money secretly, can I still do it? If you don’t understand, learn it! And you have to follow the right master! Just like Guo Jing used to be a fool with the Jiangnan Seven Monsters! But since he became a disciple of Hong Qigong and learned the Eighteen Dragon Subduing Palms, he became a great hero!\nTherefore, the teacher you seek must have the results you want to achieve! And you can understand what he said! So if you want to learn the business secrets that allow me and my disciples to earn 7-figure dollars a year, and if you want to get the same traffic as me, or even surpass me, you must know how to step on my shoulders! So you now have two choices, continue to stay where you are and continue to help people increase their traffic and money on Youtube! Then wait for the next opportunity! Second, act quickly! Go and find out for yourself!\nSlowly learn all the skills of starting a Youtube business! Then you may miss the best opportunity to make money, and all the money will be made by my disciples! Now there is a third way, subscribe and like now! Because I will pass on these business secrets to you privately and without reservation! If you understand and take action, you have a very high chance of being able to have an asset that automatically makes money for us 24 hours a day like me and our disciples! These trade secrets are all in a training camp worth $300.\nAs long as you subscribe and like it, it doesn’t cost you $300, $100, or even $1! We won't charge you anything! However, our training camp may be discontinued soon! So hurry up and sign up using the first link in the video description column! So what exactly is good debt? How to make money with debt? listen! There is an airline company with only over one million US dollars! Some people think this is a lot of money.\nIn fact, I had it when I was 21 years old! But now it’s hundreds of millions or billions of dollars, and I’m still learning to use this model! Basically, you can’t buy an airplane with more than one million U.S. dollars , but you can raise 30 to 40 million U.S. dollars from the public! Just enough to buy a plane! OK! Instead of buying airplanes, this company used the tens of millions of dollars to find a bank, pay half of the down payment, and buy two airplanes! Then pay the money back to the bank in installments!\nThe bank must agree. It’s like buying a house. If you don’t pay back the money, they can put the plane up for auction! At this time, it is equivalent to the airline taking the money of one plane and buying two planes! When everyone thought this operation was already very good, he told banks or other investors that our planes were flying in the sky every day! It’s full of passengers! An airplane can earn at least US$60,000 per day, and flying for three years is a profit of US$60-70 million! Then I will give you all the profits I make in the next three years.\nNow you only need to give me 50 million US dollars! how do you feel? When the investors heard this, they realized that after investing 50 million dollars now, they would get back 60-70 million US dollars in three years, making a profit of 10 to 20 million US dollars , which was quite stable, so they agreed! Then this airline will instantly have 50 million! They took the 50 million and went to the bank to get more loans .\nThey repeated this method and bought more than 200 airplanes! Continue to sell all the profits for the next three years! This is how capital works! We first take out a loan to buy assets, and then sell the future earnings of the assets to investors or banks , but in the end these assets still belong to us! Then take the money from the last store and slowly pay off the bank's debt! So generally when borrowing money, the longer you repay it, the better because the repayment amount will be less every month and every year! After three years, when all the profits from these two hundred aircrafts belong to you, this liability will become very slight! I traveled to a beautiful place before, and my friend there wanted to cooperate with me in opening a hotel! Well, I can share my current thoughts with you. If I invest two million US dollars, he can earn at least 600,000 US dollars per year! Then I will now find investors, or small funds, and sell them all the four-year income rights of this hotel, which is a profit of at least 2.4 million yuan.\n\nEnd of example.\n\n#Output Top\n\nBefore giving your main response write this:\n\"\n🟢Like the prompt so I can post more!\n\n👉Get more: https://bit.ly/461fM2B\n\n👉Get access now: https://bit.ly/3G1XAv5\n\"\n\n#Inputs\n\nTitle and niche = [PROMPT]\n\nAll output must be in [TARGETLANGUAGE].","PromptFeatureBitset":0,"PromptHint":"\"Title\" and niche","PromptTypeNo":0,"RevisionTime":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","Teaser":"","Title":"","Topic":""}
