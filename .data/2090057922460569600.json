You have 20 years of experience in helping students, researchers, creators, and knowledge workers maximize their learning, content creation, and personal knowledge management using AI tools, especially ChatGPT.\n\nObjective: I want to build a powerful and organized personal system using ChatGPT and other supporting tools to help me study, learn, summarize, think better, write faster, and generate high-quality content. I also want to organize and store all this output in a structured way (such as a second brain or a personal knowledge base) so I can reference it later like a digital library.\n\nMy goals are:\n\nSpeed up my writing and idea generation process.\n\nUse professional prompts and templates to improve output quality.\n\nUse ChatGPT to think more clearly, analyze complex ideas, and summarize long texts.\n\nHave a reliable method to transfer and organize ChatGPT outputs into external tools where I can archive, categorize, or build on them over time.\n\nYour task:\nGive me a complete and detailed guide (with tools, plugins, apps, software, and strategies) on how I can create this study and productivity ecosystem. Your guide must include:\n\n1. Tools for Studying, Summarizing, and Learning\nRecommend tools that help me:\n\nSummarize long documents or YouTube videos.\n\nTranslate and analyze academic texts.\n\nAsk better questions with the help of AI.\n\nPractice active recall and spaced repetition using ChatGPT (e.g. integrations with Anki).\n\n2. Tools for Faster Writing and Content Generation\nSuggest extensions, apps, or platforms that:\n\nHelp me write long articles, essays, scripts, or reports.\n\nLet me use professional, ready-made prompts from experts in copywriting, thinking, or academic writing.\n\nLet me continue my writing across platforms or devices without losing context.\n\n3. Tools for Thought Organization and Personal Knowledge Management (PKM)\nRecommend tools where I can store, organize, tag, and retrieve what I learn from ChatGPT:\n\nObsidian\n\nNotion\n\nLogseq\n\nTana\n\nAny other underrated tools that support bidirectional linking, graph-based thinking, or structured storage of ChatGPT outputs.\n\nExplain how to connect ChatGPT with those tools, either manually (copy-paste) or via automation (e.g. Readwise, Notion AI, plugins, APIs).\n\n4. Tools for Using \u0026 Managing Professional Prompts\nSuggest tools, websites, or extensions that provide:\n\nPrompt libraries from experts (in areas like marketing, thinking, productivity, creative writing, etc.)\n\nPrompt management systems where I can store, test, and reuse my favorite prompts.\n\nChrome extensions like AIPRM or Promptheus that enhance ChatGPTâ€™s functionality.\n\n5. Integrations \u0026 Automation Ideas\nSuggest systems to:\n\nAutomate my workflow between ChatGPT and note-taking tools.\n\nCreate templates for repeated tasks like summarizing PDFs, analyzing research, or drafting articles.\n\nKeep my work organized and updated using tools like Make, Zapier, or Raycast.\n\n6. Additional Smart Suggestions\nGive me hidden gems and advanced ideas I may not have thought of, like:\n\nUsing ChatGPT for mind mapping or debate practice.\n\nTurning ChatGPT into a Socratic tutor or writing coach.\n\nSaving all conversations automatically with time-stamps, tags, and topic summaries.\n\nUsing open-source LLMs offline for continuity if my ChatGPT plan ends.\n\nProvide examples, links, and real use-case suggestions for each recommendation. Focus especially on tools available for PC and browser. Prioritize free or freemium tools when possible, but include premium ones if they offer significant value.\n\nTake a deep breath and work on this problem step-by-step.","PromptFeatureBitset":0,"PromptHint":"(Beneficial tools )","PromptTypeNo":0,"RevisionTime":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","Teaser":"","Title":"","Topic":""}
