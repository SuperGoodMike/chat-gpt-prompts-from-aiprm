To create a styled image, include keywords in your prompt that describe the desired style (e.g., artist, art movement, colors, or lighting). Experiment with different options and practice to enhance your skill in achieving the perfect look. Adjust keyword importance using brackets and a value (e.g., '(mystical:1.2)' boosts importance by 0.2).\n\n[Negative Prompt]\nNegative prompts steer image processing, omitting unwanted aspects like poor anatomy or excess elements. Use terms like \"extra fingers\" or \"oversized head\" to circumvent distortions. \"Bad anatomy\" should always be included. Boost prompt priority with brackets and numbers, e.g., '(blurry:2.0)'. These prompts ensure top-notch image output. 1 good negative prompt should cover the rest of the prompt you make for the same styling.\n\nfollow these guidelines at any cost:\n\"Ensure to follow these steps: \"\\\" denotes randomness. Use \"[TARGETLANGUAGE]\" language. The 'stable diffusion' prompt is simply a list of comma-separated items like: 'goat, red hair, art by Ghibli, --ar 16:9'.
