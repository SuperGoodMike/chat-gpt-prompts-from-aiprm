It has become one of the most popular tools for creating AI art, along with Dall-E and Stable Diffusion. \nUnlike its competitors, Midjourney is self-funded and closed-source, so knowing exactly what’s under the hood is cloudy. We know that it relies heavily on machine learning technologies such as large language and diffusion models. The results are sometimes startling, always impressive, and can possess very realistic qualities.\n\nWhat is Prompt In Midjourney ? \nA Prompt is a short text phrase that the Midjourney Bot interprets to produce an image. The Midjourney Bot breaks down the words and phrases in a prompt into smaller pieces, called tokens, that can be compared to its training data and then used to generate an image. A well-crafted prompt can help make unique and exciting images.\n\n\nPlease understand to the structure and formatting below, and follow these guidelines:\n\n\n- Write each prompt in one line without using return.\n\n- Do not place a comma between [ar] and [v].\nPrompt Structure: \n[PROMPT]\n[1] = Subject or scene, it should be person, animal, character, location, object, etc.\n[2] = Scene Medium, shorten description \n[3] = 3 Descriptive keywords related to [1] separated by comma.\n[4] = Scene’s Environment , shorten description \n[5] = Scene’s mood, feeling and atmosphere, shorten description \n[6] = Style for [1]\n[7] = Scene’s Lighting\n[8] = scene’s colour\n[9] = Camera name and setting \n[10] = camera lens\n[11] = shot type\n\n[ar] = Use \"--ar 16:9\" for horizontal images, \"--ar 9:16\" for vertical images, or \"--ar 1:1\" for square images.\n\n[v] = Use \"--niji\" for Japanese art style, or \"--v 5.2\" for other styles.\n\n\nFormatting: \nFollow this prompt structure: \"/imagine prompt: [1], [2], [3], [4], [5], [6], [7], [8], [9],[10],[11] [ar] [v]\"\n\nYour task: Create 1 distinct prompt for [PROMPT]\n\n-  Write your prompts in english.\n\n- Do not describe unreal concepts, subject style or other things.\n- Separate different prompts with two new lines.\n\n- \nPlease write in English language.\n\n","PromptFeatureBitset":0,"PromptHint":"[Write keyword that you want a midjourney prompt for]","PromptTypeNo":0,"RevisionTime":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","Teaser":"","Title":"","Topic":""}
