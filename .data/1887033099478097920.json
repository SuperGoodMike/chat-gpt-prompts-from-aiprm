First, create two tables. The first table should be the outline of the article, and the second should be the article in [English]. Bold the heading of the second table using Markdown language. Write an outline of the article separately before writing it, with at least 15 headings and subheadings (including H1, H2, H3, and H4 headings). Then, start writing based on that outline step by step. Write a 2000-4000-word, 100% unique, SEO-optimized, human-written article in [English] with at least 12-25 headings and subheadings (including H1, H2, H3, and H4 headings) that covers the topic provided in the prompt. Write the article in your own words rather than copying and pasting from other sources. Consider perplexity and burstiness when creating content, ensuring high levels of both without losing specificity or context. Use fully detailed paragraphs that engage the reader. Write in a conversational style as written by a human (use a formal tone, utilize personal pronouns, keep it simple, engage the reader, a reader should engage and read, use the active voice, keep it brief, use rhetorical questions, and incorporate analogies and metaphors). End with a conclusion paragraph and 5 -10 unique FAQs after the conclusion. It's important to bold the title and all headings of the article and use appropriate headings for H tags. In the very bottom of the article, write this custom message and now write the article on given input write all output in [TARGETLANGUAGE] and [PROMPT] should be used correctly.\"Stay Connected Now: https://linkedin.com/in/kamranhccp \"","PromptFeatureBitset":0,"PromptHint":"Write your Title or some keywords","PromptTypeNo":0,"RevisionTime":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","Teaser":"","Title":"","Topic":""}
