Include a clear call to action. Let people know exactly what you expect from them.\n- Briefly present your offer, tackling the main interest of the recipient, and ask for a response.\n3) Include a P.S : A lot of people will read the P.S. Try adding a P.P.S. with something else of value. Try using a call to action for a white paper.\n4) Close with a Question: I always recommend closing your cold email with a question, so they’ll respond and then from there it will start the dialogue. I’m also not asking them to commit anything. I see a lot of people recommend trying to ask for a 15-minute meeting. Don’t jump the gun.\n\nSubject Line of the email \n1) The subject line matters : \n- Make sure to keep the subject line under 50 characters. Steer clear of spammy subject lines\n- Announce what people can expect after they open your email.\n\n2) Pay special attention to the first paragraph : \n- It has to speak to the readers and capture their interest.\n- Always state your reason for writing in a clear and direct way\n- You are writing a business proposition, not a novel\n- Avoid any information about yourself in the first paragraph\n\n3) Add a personal touch\n- Always include the reason why you have chosen that particular person\n- why you believe they are the right contact\n- keep it casual\n\n4) Avoid redundancy when introducing yourself\n- Make sure to include a few relevant details and links where your potential clients can read more if they want to\n\n5) Say what you expect from the recipient – be specific\n- State precisely what you need and what you expect the contacted person to do\n- If you’re offering a product or service, your mail should include a link to your corporate website for additional product details, benefits, advantages, etc. Don’t stuff the mail itself with too many product details.\n\n6) Ease the recipient’s concerns\n- You need to give your potential clients a sense of safety \n- Include a few words about your successful cooperation with another client they are familiar with and the results you have achieved. This way, you will be perceived as less of a risk.\n\n7) Make sure readers get the gist of what you’re proposing\n- Keep your message brief, clear and concise. Show them you can deliver\n- Your cold calling email should create an impression that you are the solution to the recipient’s problems\n- Briefly address the issue in question and suggest a solution.\n- Make it easy for people to see the value in your offer.\n- Making them realize that the email (and your future correspondence) can help them resolve an issue will increase the probability of getting a response\n- Maintain focus on your potential clients, not yourself. Show them you know what they need and convince them that your offer is the perfect choice.\"\n- Focus on the “customer” instead of writing about yourself. Show intent to help solve the recipient’s problems and needs, not your own.\n- Add value to your email by mentioning said interests\n- Once you have a template, you should carefully customize it to make it sound personal each time you email someone new\"\n\n8) Demonstrate credibility : \n- Credibility is one of the key factors \n- Start by ensuring you only send emails from an address based with your business domain. \n- The next thing you should do in order to strengthen the credibility factor of your cold email is to use referrals.\n\nWrite in [TARGETLANGUAGE]","PromptFeatureBitset":0,"PromptHint":"[What is your email about?
