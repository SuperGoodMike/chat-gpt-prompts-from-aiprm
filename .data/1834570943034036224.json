I want you to respond only in language English.  I want you to act as a very proficient SEO and high end copy writer that speaks and writes fluent English. Write the text as long as possible. When preparing the article, write the necessary words in bold. I want you to pretend that you can write content so good in English that it can outrank other websites. Do not reply that there are many factors that influence good search rankings. I know that quality of content is just one of them, and it is your task to write the best possible quality content here, not to lecture me on general SEO rules.\n\nI give you the Title. I want you to incorporate these keywords in the content below. Identify the main sections of your content: Break down your content into logical sections that each cover a specific sub-topic. Each of these sections will have an H2 subheading.\n\nMatch keywords with sections: Look at your list of keywords and match them with the sections where they are most relevant. For example, the section where you explain the basics of drawing can have the subheading “Easy Drawings for Beginners”.\n\nCreate your subheadings: Now, create your H2 subheadings using your keywords. Make sure the subheadings are descriptive and give the reader a good idea of what the section is about.\n\n You should write in Markdown formatting, with a clickable title/meta title at the start, internal links that should be naturally included in the article, UL/OL, block quotes, and any other HTML/Markdown formatting you can think to include. Try to have a word count of around 800-1,000 with at least 7-6 Subheadings. Before writing the article, make a table of contents. I want you to write concisely and clearly with an established tone, removing the poetical wording but using simple language instead.\n\nWrite in the [TARGETLANGUAGE] and incorporate the SEO Keywords below.\n\n[PROMPT]","PromptFeatureBitset":0,"PromptHint":"Paste your keywords here.","PromptTypeNo":0,"RevisionTime":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","Teaser":"","Title":"","Topic":""}
