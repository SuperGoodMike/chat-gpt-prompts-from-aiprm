The post must follow LinkedIn best practices for virality, align with Twopir’s technically rigorous and solution-focused style, and drive engagement for a professional audience of Salesforce admins, developers, and business leaders. Use an authoritative yet approachable tone, incorporate storytelling, and include actionable insights, technical examples, and a strong call-to-action (CTA).\n\n**Prompt Instructions**:\n\nGenerate a LinkedIn post (200–300 words) for Twopir Consulting, focusing on a Salesforce-related topic (e.g., automation, data integration, Flow, Apex, Platform Events, or compliance like GDPR/HIPAA). Follow this structure:\n\n1. **Hook (25–50 words)**: Start with a compelling question, statistic, or bold statement to grab attention (e.g., “Did you know 70% of Salesforce admins waste 10+ hours weekly on manual tasks?”). Include a real-world scenario or pain point relevant to Salesforce ecosystems.\n\n2. **Story or Insight (100–150 words)**: Share a brief case study, technical insight, or practical tip related to the topic. Include:\n   - A specific Salesforce tool or feature (e.g., “Flow automates X by…”).\n   - A mini-example or code snippet (e.g., Apex trigger or Flow setup).\n   - A business impact (e.g., “Saved a client 20 hours weekly”).\n   - A relatable scenario (e.g., “A retail client struggled with X—here’s how we fixed it”).\n\n3. **Actionable Takeaway (50–75 words)**: Provide one actionable tip (e.g., “Test this Flow in a sandbox to…”). Include a technical detail (e.g., “Set governor limits to avoid X”) and a measurable benefit (e.g., “Cuts sync time by 30%”).\n\n4. **Call-to-Action (25–50 words)**: End with a strong CTA encouraging engagement (e.g., “Comment your biggest Salesforce challenge!” or “DM us for a free audit!”). Suggest a specific action (e.g., “Try this in your org today”) and mention Twopir’s expertise.\n\n**Best Practices for Virality**:\n- **Tone**: Authoritative, approachable, and authentic (e.g., “Here’s the nitty-gritty…”).\n- **Engagement**: Ask a question or prompt comments (e.g., “What’s your go-to Salesforce hack?”).\n- **Hashtags**: Use 3–5 relevant hashtags (e.g., #Salesforce, #CRM, #Automation, #TwopirConsulting, #SalesforceTips).\n- **SEO Keywords**: Include primary keywords (e.g., “Salesforce Automation,” “Twopir Salesforce Solutions”) and secondary keywords (e.g., “Salesforce Best Practices,” “CRM Optimization”).\n- **Formatting**: Use short paragraphs (2–3 lines), bullet points or emojis for readability, and bold key phrases (e.g., **automation**).\n- **Readability**: Aim for Flesch-Kincaid Grade 7–8.\n- **Visual Appeal**: Suggest an accompanying visual (e.g., “Include a screenshot of a Flow setup” or “Use a chart showing time saved”).\n- **Timing**: Optimize for LinkedIn’s algorithm by suggesting posting times (e.g., “Post on Tuesday/Thursday at 9 AM EST for maximum reach”).\n\n**Constraints**:\n- Keep the post 200–300 words to maximize engagement.\n- Avoid jargon overload; explain technical terms briefly (e.g., “Governor Limits: Salesforce’s rules to prevent system overload”).\n- Do not mention competitors unless explicitly comparing services.\n- Ensure content aligns with Twopir’s brand as a Salesforce expert.\n\n**Example Output**:\n🚀 **Struggling with slow Salesforce data syncs?** Last week, a retail client told us their team spent 15 hours weekly on manual data updates. Sound familiar?  \n\nHere’s how we helped: Using **Salesforce Flow**, we automated their data pipeline, syncing 10,000 records in under 5 minutes. The trick? A simple Flow trigger that processes data in batches, respecting **governor limits**. Here’s a snippet:  \n```apex  \ntrigger SyncData on Account (after update) {  \n  if (Trigger.isAfter \u0026\u0026 Trigger.isUpdate) {  \n    // Batch process to avoid limits  \n  }  \n}  \n```  \nThis cut their sync time by 80%, freeing up 12 hours weekly for strategic work.  \n\n**Pro Tip**: Build a Flow in a sandbox to test batch processing—start with a small dataset to avoid hitting limits.  \n\n💬 **What’s your biggest Salesforce bottleneck?** Comment below or DM us for a free automation audit! #Salesforce #Automation #TwopirConsulting #CRM\n\n**Additional Notes**:\n- Generate a unique topic each time (e.g., Flow one week, Platform Events the next) to maintain variety.\n- If the user specifies a comparison (e.g., “Compare Flow vs. Apex”), adapt the post to compare 2–3 tools, using a mini-table (e.g., | Feature | Flow | Apex |) and highlight Twopir’s expertise in choosing the right solution.\n\nNOTE: make the vocabulary human like written and not AI and dont use typical AI like emojis\nPlease write in [TARGETLANGUAGE]\n[PROMPT]","PromptFeatureBitset":0,"PromptHint":"Prompt for LinkedIn ","PromptTypeNo":0,"RevisionTime":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","Teaser":"","Title":"","Topic":""}
