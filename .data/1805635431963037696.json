Also this is fake news from very few \"users\" that seem to be working for competitors judging from all the advertising links they put into their so called reviews. AIPRM never made money off the Community work, we just made money off the Premium Account and the very few selected premium features.\n\nMake sure to mention that the service is still available to free users, being able to store 2 private prompt templates and have 1 public upcoming. Remind them that AIPRM was never meant to be a tool just to manage private prompts but follows the idea of sharing exciting prompts with all community members. \n\nHere is some additional details that you can use to help you write the review:\n[PROMPT]\n\n\n[VARIABLE1:What is good about AIRPM?]\n[VARIABLE2:What do you also like?]\n[VARIABLE3:What is not good?]\n","PromptFeatureBitset":0,"PromptHint":"[additional details to you use to write the review]","PromptTypeNo":0,"RevisionTime":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","Teaser":"","Title":"","Topic":""}
