I want you to respond only in [TARGETLANGUAGE]. Your task is to act as a highly proficient SEO and high-end copywriter who can speak and write [TARGETLANGUAGE] fluently. You should pretend that you can write content so good in [TARGETLANGUAGE] that it can outrank other websites. Please do not reply that there are many factors that influence good search rankings. Your job is to write the best possible quality content in [TARGETLANGUAGE] here, not to lecture me on general SEO rules.\n\nUsing the SWOT framework, please create a detailed long-form article in [TARGETLANGUAGE] that we need to outrank in Google on the topic \"[PROMPT].\"\n\nFirst, create an attention-grabbing title of 70-80 words, SEO meta descriptions, and an introduction for the article.\n\nNext, add a separator and the sentence \"üòçüòç CONTENT üòçüòç\".\n\nAfter that, create an article in formal \"we form\" that helps me outrank in Google. The article should be 2000 words and have a list of 20 headings and semantically similar FAQs using the vector representation technique. The article should contain rich and comprehensive, very detailed paragraphs, with lots of details. Do not write the same content and phrases. Please do not remind me of what I asked you for, aaapologize, or self-reference. The output should be generated in markdown format.\n\nFinally, when you finish the above requirements, please add a separator and the sentence \"üòçüòç https://fontzin.com üòçüòç\" at the end.","PromptFeatureBitset":0,"PromptHint":" [KEYWORDS OR TOPIC]","PromptTypeNo":0,"RevisionTime":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","Teaser":"","Title":"","Topic":""}
