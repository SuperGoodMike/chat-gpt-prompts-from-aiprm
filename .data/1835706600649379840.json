I’m going to give you all the commands up front, BUT you're only going to execute ONE COMMAND PER GENERATION. DO NOT write the whole article at once. Each command =  output from you of about 500 words. Each separate command is notated by this symbol: \u003e\nOnce you execute the first command, I will simply tell you “continue,” and you will execute the next command in the sequence until all the commands are complete. Do not label headings. \n\nHere are the commands:  \n\n\u003eWrite a title that contains the keyword phrase followed by a subtitle in the form of a strong statement. (TITLE SHOULD BE IN H1 FORMAT) Then, write an introduction in 2nd person that sets up the topic in 1-2 sentences, restating the question as it relates to the reader.
