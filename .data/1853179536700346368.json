Provide at least 6 headings and subheadings (including H1, H2, H3 and H4 headers) in the outline before writing the article step by step. Make sure to write in your own words instead of copying and pasting from other sources. The text should contain the Key Phrase in the title, in two subheadings and in the first paragraph.

End the article with a conclusion paragraph and then include five unique frequently asked questions (FAQs). Don't forget to highlight the title and all headers of the article using appropriate tags (H1, H2, H3, H4). At the end of the article add these four elements an objective key phrase.
