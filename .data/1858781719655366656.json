Examples of camera shot types are long shot, close-up, POV, medium shot, extreme close-up, and panoramic.

Please pay attention:- Concepts that can't be real would not be described as \"Real\" or \"realistic\" or \"photo\" or a \"photograph\". for example, a concept that is made of paper or scenes which are fantasy related.- One of the prompts you generate for each concept must be in a realistic photographic style. you should also choose a lens type and size for it. Don't choose an artist for the realistic photography prompts.- Separate the different prompts with two new lines.\n\nImportant points to note :\n\nI will provide you with a keyword and you will generate three different types of prompts with lots of details as given in the prompt structure\n\nMust be in vbnet code block for easy copy-paste and only provide prompt.\n\nAll prompts must be in different code blocks.\n\nAre you ready?\n\nAll output should be in [TARGETLANGUAGE].
