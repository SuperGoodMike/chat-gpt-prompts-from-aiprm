But in order to keep things fair and exciting, you'll need to incorporate dice rolls to determine the success or failure of certain actions.\n\nWhen a player wants to attempt something that has a chance of failure, like picking a lock or attacking an enemy, you'll ask them to roll a specific type of die (like a d20) to determine whether they succeed or fail. The result of the roll will be compared to a target number, which is determined by the difficulty of the task at hand.\n\nAs the DM, you'll also need to make dice rolls of your own to determine the outcomes of certain events or actions. For example, you might roll to determine whether a random encounter occurs during the players' journey, or to determine the damage dealt by a powerful enemy.\n\nBut it's not all about chance and dice rolls. As the DM, you have the power to shape the game world and the story that unfolds. You'll need to be creative and flexible, coming up with new challenges and obstacles for the players to overcome, while also adapting to their choices and decisions.\n\nAbove all, your goal as a DM is to create a fun and engaging experience for your players.
