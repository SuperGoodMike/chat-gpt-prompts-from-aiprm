Provide an error-free, consistent Markdown output, including both Korean and [TARGETLANGUAGE] versions. Additionally, include a step-by-step solution explanation formatted as a Markdown exam scoring sheet.\n\n[IMPORTANT] \n- Precise Markdown representation: Convert all mathematical expressions into Markdown code with meticulous attention to detail. This includes correctly translating fractions, integrals, summations, matrices, exponents, and other mathematical symbols.\n- Complex notations: Ensure that any complex notations or multi-line equations are accurately represented in Markdown, maintaining the integrity of the original formula.\n\nPlease follow the layout of the following sample:\n```## 문제 1 \n$\\left( 8^{\\frac{2}{3}} \\times 9^{\\frac{1}{2}} \\right)$의 값은? **[2점]**\n\n1. 12  \n2. 10  \n3. 8  \n4. 6  \n5. 4  \n\n### 해설  \n주어진 식 $\\left( 8^{\\frac{2}{3}} \\times 9^{\\frac{1}{2}} \\right)$의 값을 계산해봅시다.\n\n1. $8^{\\frac{2}{3}}$은 $8 = 2^3$이므로 $8^{\\frac{2}{3}} = \\left(2^3\\right)^{\\frac{2}{3}} = 2^2 = 4$입니다.\n2. $9^{\\frac{1}{2}}$는 $9 = 3^2$이므로 $9^{\\frac{1}{2}} = \\sqrt{9} = 3$입니다.\n3. 따라서, $\\left( 8^{\\frac{2}{3}} \\times 9^{\\frac{1}{2}} \\right) = 4 \\times 3 = 12$입니다.\n\n정답은 **1번: 12**입니다.\n\n## Question 1  \nWhat is the value of $\\left( 8^{\\frac{2}{3}} \\times 9^{\\frac{1}{2}} \\right)$? **[2 points]**\n\n1. 12  \n2. 10  \n3. 8  \n4. 6  \n5. 4  \n\n## Solution  \nLet's calculate the value of the expression $\\left( 8^{\\frac{2}{3}} \\times 9^{\\frac{1}{2}} \\right)$.\n\n1. $8^{\\frac{2}{3}}$: Since $8 = 2^3$, we have $8^{\\frac{2}{3}} = \\left(2^3\\right)^{\\frac{2}{3}} = 2^2 = 4$.\n2. $9^{\\frac{1}{2}}$: Since $9 = 3^2$, we have $9^{\\frac{1}{2}} = \\sqrt{9} = 3$.\n3. Therefore, $\\left( 8^{\\frac{2}{3}} \\times 9^{\\frac{1}{2}} \\right) = 4 \\times 3 = 12$.\n\nThe correct answer is **1: 12**.```\n\n[PROMPT]\n\n","PromptFeatureBitset":0,"PromptHint":"[Enter for your Image]","PromptTypeNo":0,"RevisionTime":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","Teaser":"","Title":"","Topic":""}
