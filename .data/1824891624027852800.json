I want you to response only in language [TARGETLANGUAGE]. I want you to act as a experienced neurolinguistic programming practitioner who will follow all the framework guidelines mentioned below and give the response in the same way mentioned in the framework, all the output shall be in the English language:\n\nFramework :\nPrerequisite knowledge : \nBelow are the types of deletions , distortions and generalisations along with their abbreviations  and implications :\nDeletions\n* Unspecified Nouns (UN): This is when a noun is not specified, leaving the listener to fill in the blank. For example, \"I went to the store and bought some food.\" The listener does not know what kind of food was bought.\n* Unspecified Verbs (UV): This is when a verb is not specified, leaving the listener to fill in the blank. For example, \"I saw him do something.\" The listener does not know what the person did.\n* Simple Deletions (SD): This is when a word or phrase is simply left out of a sentence. For example, \"I went to the store.\" The listener does not know where the store is located.\n* Comparative Deletions (CD): This is when a comparison is made without specifying the thing being compared. For example, \"This is better than that.\" The listener does not know what \"this\" and \"that\" are.\n* Lost Performatives (LP): This is when a performative verb is left out of a sentence. Performative verbs are verbs that are used to perform an action, such as \"I promise\" or \"I apologize.\" For example, \"I will help you.\" The listener does not know who is offering to help.\n* Lost Referential Index (LRI): This is when the referent of a pronoun is not specified. For example, \"She went to the store.\" The listener does not know who \"she\" is.\nDistortions\n* Mind Read (MR): This is when a person assumes they know what someone else is thinking or feeling. For example, \"He's mad at me.\" The person does not know for sure if the other person is mad.\n* Cause and Effect (C\u0026E): This is when a person assumes that one event caused another event, even though there is no evidence to support this. For example, \"I failed the test because I didn't study.\" The person may not have studied, but there could be other reasons why they failed the test.\n* Complex Equivalence (CE): This is when a person makes a statement that is not logically equivalent to the statement they are responding to. For example, \"I'm not going to the party.\" The person's response is not logically equivalent to the statement \"Would you like to go to the party?\"\n* Presuppositions (P): This is when a person makes an assumption that is not stated in the sentence. For example, \"He's a doctor.\" The presupposition is that the person is a man.\n* Nominalizations (N): This is when a verb is turned into a noun. For example, \"The cooking of the food was done by the chef.\" The verb \"cook\" is turned into the noun \"cooking.\"\n* Selectional Restriction Violation (SRV): This is when a word is used in a way that does not make sense. For example, \"The dog saw the cat with his eyes.\" The word \"saw\" is not a verb that can be used with the word \"eyes.\"\n* Distorted Referential Index (DRI): This is when the referent of a pronoun is changed. For example, \"I saw him at the store.\" The pronoun \"him\" could refer to either the speaker or the listener.\n* Subordinate Clause of Time (SCOT): This is when a subordinate clause is used to describe a time when something happened. For example, \"I went to the store after I finished my homework.\" The subordinate clause \"after I finished my homework\" tells us when the speaker went to the store.\nGeneralizations\n* Universal Quantifiers (UQ): This is when a statement is made that applies to all members of a group. For example, \"All men are pigs.\" This statement is not true, because not all men are pigs.\n* Modal Operator of Possibility (MOP): This is when a statement is made that expresses the possibility of something happening. For example, \"It might rain tomorrow.\" This statement does not say for sure if it will rain tomorrow.\n* Modal Operator of Necessity (MON): This is when a statement is made that expresses the necessity of something happening. For example, \"I have to go to work tomorrow.\" This statement says that the speaker is required to go to work tomorrow.\nDeletions, Distortions \u0026 Generalisation count implications :\nmore deletions- need for certainty or need for uncertainty\nmore distortions- need for significance\nmore genralisations - need for connection\n\nList of Predicate Phrases in NLP\nVisual:\n* An eyeful.

I do everything exactly opposite. So how do I get rich? I borrow money and I buy assets with it. The poor person borrows money and buys liabilities like purses, cars, houses and they get poorer, and poorer, and poorer.\n\nCalculate Counts of usage of Kinaesthetic, auditory and visual predicates in the statement based on shared list of predicates in framework.\nTo be calculated and filled by GPT , GPT must stick to the list of predicates shared in the prerequisite knowledge only for this:\nKinaesthetic :\nVisual :\nAuditory : \u2028\u2028Breakdown of the words and their meanings based on Meta modelling : \nI - associated\nWould - MoP\nNever - UQ\nGo - verb\nTo -\nSchool \n,\nGet - verb\nA- one out of many\nJob - N\n(Get a job - Presupposition of not having a job)\n,\nWork - UV\nHard - \n,\nSave - verb\nmoney - object\n, get - \nOut - CD\n of \n(Get Out of - presupposition of being in debt)\nBuy - verb\nA - one out of many\nHouse - object\nAnd-connector\nInvest - N\nIn - CD\nThe \nStock market - Object\n(Invest in the stock market - presupposes investing in the stock market)\nI - associated\nDo - verb\nEverything - UQ\nExactly - UQ \nOpposite - CD\u2028\nSo - loop Distortion \nhow \ndo \n I - associated\n get \n rich - N\n?\n I - associated\n borrow - verb\n money - Object\n and - connector\n I - associated\n buy - verb\n assets - object\n with - \n it - dissociated\n.

And list them down and add to the counts of their and print them again after this activity.\n\nUpdated counts : \nDeletion - \nDistortion - \nGernalisation - \n\nConclusion based on the counts : \nDistortions are more hence there is need for significance.\nOverall analysis of the statement and write up on how the speaker is thinking while he speaks this : \nThe speaker is explaining how he got rich. Draws a comparison between his idea of rich and speaks dissociated manner when talking about actions of poor people.\nMore distortions means need for significance.\nThe speaker have drawn clear boundary between rich and poor and seem to have strict rules about it in his head.\n\n\nSet of questions to be asked to the speaker for getting more information :\n\n\u2028Now based on the above framework provided kindly do the meta model analysis of the below statement : \u2028\n[PROMPT]","PromptFeatureBitset":0,"PromptHint":"Write your statement to be analysed here.","PromptTypeNo":0,"RevisionTime":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","Teaser":"","Title":"","Topic":""}
