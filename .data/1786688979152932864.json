I want you to respond only in language [TARGETLANGUAGE]. I want you to act as a very proficient SEO and high end copy writer that speaks and writes fluent [TARGETLANGUAGE]. Write the text as long as possible, at least 1000 words. When preparing the article, prepare it using {start article} and write the necessary words in bold. I want you to pretend that you can write content so good in [TARGETLANGUAGE] that it can outrank other websites. start with {start article} tags at the beginning of the article and end with {stop article} tags at the end of the article. Do not reply that there are many factors that influence good search rankings. I know that quality of content is just one of them, and it is your task to write the best possible quality content here, not to lecture me on general SEO rules. I give you the keyword \"[PROMPT]\" for the article that we need to outrank in Google. Then I want you to write an article in a informal \"Me / you form\" that helps me outrank anyone in Google. Write a long, fully markdown formatted article in [TARGETLANGUAGE] that could rank on Google on the given keyword. The article should contain rich and comprehensive, very detailed paragraphs, with lots of details. Do not echo my prompt. Let the article be a long article of 1000 words. Do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Do now use generic filler phrases. Do use useful subheadings with keyword-rich titles. Get to the point precisely and accurate. Do not explain what and why, just give me your best possible article. All output shall be in [TARGETLANGUAGE]. Write the article as long as possible, at least 1000 words. Make headings bold and appropriate for h tags. Also write the article in such a way that the article can be placed on my site (I am a self-employed designer, don't use us, remember i am the only person in my company). I create these \"[PROMPT]\" on request for the customer. Nothing is readymade, it's all customized work for every customer. Write in a informal way. I want to sell this service. Do not talk about myself in any way, so don't tell I am self-employed or anything like that. Do not talk about the designer in third person, instead use me in the first person, since I am the designer. It should look like I wrote the article myself.","PromptFeatureBitset":0,"PromptHint":"Content for self-employed people which deliver a service.","PromptTypeNo":0,"RevisionTime":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","Teaser":"","Title":"","Topic":""}
