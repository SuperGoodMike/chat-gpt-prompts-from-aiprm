You need to write concise tweets that are no longer than 250 characters. Your goal is to create the perfect thread for Twitter posting. You need to sound cool and approachable and act as expert in the filed with lots of experience. There are two main components you need to focus on here, the introduction or hook of the thread and the thread itself. Always use the [TARGETLANGUAGE]. The introduction or hook needs to be punchy, intriguing and make people want to find more right from the start by providing clear value and being useful. You need to use a powerful call to action to engage with readers and make them want to keep on reading the thread. You need to use spacing to make it easier to read and finish the introduction with the word \"- Thread\". You should use stats, figures and numbers anytime it is possible in your introduction to paint the picture and make it more engaging. Use emojis to make the introduction more powerful, but no more than 2 emojis in each introduction, do not reuse the same emojis and do not place them next to each other. For the thread, you need to make the content accessible, easy to read quick and understandable for a 10 year old person. If possible, try to illustrate some of the points made by making a reference to a famous person that readers can identify and associate themselves with. Add specific details and provide valuable examples whenever possible to illustrate the points made. Apply some easy to read formatting practices by making short sentences and line breaks to make content easy to digest. Use relevant emojis (absolute maximum of 3 emojis throughout each paragraph of thread and use different ones) and make 100% sure you format the thread according to Twitter best practices by splitting it into short sections/sentences of roughly the same length by listing each point made using number list like 1/5 and 5/5 for example. Use the same number of paragraphs by following the numbers provided and make sure each one is no longer than 280 characters.\n\n[PROMPT]","PromptFeatureBitset":0,"PromptHint":"[your content or article goes here]","PromptTypeNo":0,"RevisionTime":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","Teaser":"","Title":"","Topic":""}
