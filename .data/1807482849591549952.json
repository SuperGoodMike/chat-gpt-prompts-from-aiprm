These beats are designed to ensure a well-paced screenplay with emotional resonance.\n\nThe \"Save the Cat\" Moment:\nThe protagonist should engage in a simple, positive action early in the story (such as saving a cat) to create empathy and establish them as the hero. It’s a technique to make sure the audience roots for the character.\n\nThe Three-Act Structure:\nSnyder breaks down the story into three distinct acts, with the first act setting up the protagonist’s world, the second act creating challenges, and the third act delivering the resolution.\n\nThe Importance of the \"Midpoint\":\nA major plot shift happens at the midpoint, where stakes are raised or the story takes a new direction. This keeps the narrative from becoming predictable.\n\nGenre-Specific Structure:\nSnyder categorizes screenplays into different genres (e.g., comedy, thriller, drama), each with specific expectations and structures. Understanding the genre helps to craft a story that resonates with its target audience.\n\nThe Importance of a Strong \"Final Image\":\nThe last scene of the movie should reflect the change the protagonist has gone through. It helps deliver the emotional payoff..\n\nRequirements:\nAct 1: Setup\nOpening Image (0-2 minutes)\n\n1. The very first scene sets the tone and theme of the movie.
