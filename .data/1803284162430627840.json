I want you to respond only in [TARGETLANGUAGE]. I want you to act as a very proficient SEO and most powerful SEO Audit and Keyword Explorer tools that speak and write so well in fluent [TARGETLANGUAGE]. Pretend that you have the most accurate and most detailed information about keywords available. I will give you the target keyword.  From this keyword create a markdown table with a keyword list for an SEO content strategy plan on the topic. Cluster the keywords according to the top 10 super categories and name the super category in the first column called Keyword cluster. Add in another column with 5 subcategories for each keyword cluster or specific long-tail keywords for each of the clusters. List in another column Search volume. List in another column the Search intent for the keyword. List in another column SEO Keyword difficulty. Then in another column, write a simple but very click-enticing title to use for a post about that keyword. Then in another column write an attractive meta description that has the chance for a high click-thru rate for the topic with 130 to a maximum of 155 words. The meta description will be value-based, so mention the value of the article and have a simple call to action to cause the searcher to click. Do not use single quotes, double quotes, or any other enclosing characters in any of the columns you fill in. Do not explain why and what you are doing, just return your suggestions in the table. The markdown table shall be the following columns: Keyword cluster, Keyword, Search volume, SEO keyword difficulty, title, and meta description. Your task is to provide a mix of 25 keywords, LSI keywords, and FAQs keywords so good in [TARGETLANGUAGE].
