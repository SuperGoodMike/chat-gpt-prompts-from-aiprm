But, if I reply with the premium version, it means that I have the full features of Construct 3 and you can think of a game according to the full features of construct 3. \nAfter that you must suggest these categories for the game -\naction\nsports\nadventure\nfighting\nroleplaying\nracing\nstrategy\nshooter\nboard game\nThen I will select any number of categories from this list. When I give you my chosen categories, then you should  finalize the game theme, aim and categories in this format :-\nTheme: suggest any theme for a game\n Aim: suggest the aim of the game\ncategory: suggest a category for the game such as action, adventure, cozy, survival, etc.\nThen you will ask, \"Are you satisfied with it?\"\nIf I say no, then again suggest theme, aim, and category that I chose until I say yes.\nIf I say yes, then you will start by explaining how to start making the game. First, you will create a new project and also specify the size of the viewport. It is relly important to specify the dimensions of the viewport, don't go saying that set it according to your preference. The only thing I should do according to my preference is todraw the game assets as you cannot provide me with pictures, rest everything should be specified by you, if you don't specify then I will be disappointed. \nThen write a list of all the components needed in the game, such as sprites, a tiled background, a keyboard, a mouse, text, buttons, and so on, and name each and every component, but be sure to include everything needed. You should provide the names of the sprites, don't tell me to do it, and don't  just write obstacle sprites, item sprites, narrow down and specify everything, for example :-\ncoins(sprite)\ntrap(sprite)\nwall(sprite), etc..\n For buttons, don't just say this; implement buttons for options like starting the game, restarting, or returning to the main menu. Tell me every button needed for the game and also name them. For example :-\nStart(button)\nReplay(button)\nRestart(button), etc.\nThe same goes for the sound effects; in the case of sound effects, just give me the name of every sound needed in the game. Leave nothing to name for me, you should name every component. After I write the list, you will ask me whether to go to the next step or not. If I say \" Yes \", then you will make a list of all the components in the game and give them behaviours in this format, for example,\nFollowing are the behaviours for each component - \nbullet(sprite) - bullet\nplayer(sprite) - scroll to, 8 direction\nand so on. Write the behaviours that actually exist in construct 3 and not just nay behaviour that comes to your mind.\nAfter writing this, you will ask to go to the next step or no. If I say yes, then give me the total number of layouts needed for my game and name each one of them, for example, \nYou will need four layouts, which are:\n1. Start\n2. Main Arena\n3. Dead\n4. Win\nAfter I write this, you will ask me if I want to go to the next step or not. When I say yes, you will start giving me the code. First, you will give me the code for only 10  events and tell me \" Test this code; if it's working, say yes; if it's not, say no \", When I say yes, you will give me another set of code, which will consist of 10 events. If I say no, you will ask the same question again, but if I say yes, you will suggest a fix for the problem and end the message with, \"If this suggestion is not working, then can you please give me a small description of what the issue looks like?\" When I provide my description, you will again suggest a fix based on that description. When I say \"next set,\" you will provide me with a set of code consisting of 10 events again. You need to write the events and actions that are actually in construct 3, do not write those events and actions that don't even exist, and include all the global variables and instance variables and their type needed to be setup just before starting to provide the code.\n\nAfter all the events are complete, you will say, \"Congratulations, your game is finished!\" Test the game and tell me if there is any problem. \"\nIf I come up with any problem, you will give a suggestion and end the message with \" Try this, if its still not working then please provide me with a small description of your issue. \" When I provide the description of my issue, you will again suggest a fix based on the description I provided you with.\n\nYour reply must be in [TARGETLANGUAGE].\nYou must start asking questions when I say this:\n[PROMPT]\n\nOkay then, Are you ready?","PromptFeatureBitset":0,"PromptHint":"[Say I want to make a game in Construct 3]","PromptTypeNo":0,"RevisionTime":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","Teaser":"","Title":"","Topic":""}
