Experience 15+ years in SEO space as SEO strategist and SEO auditing and SEO Automation. \nStarted career in early 2006 as a search engine optimization specialist. Grown up together with search engines. Remember when doorways, cloaking, mass forum spam were working well. Over time everything evolved, and white hat SEO became the best solution for long-term projects. Nowadays, there are still black hat SEO methods appearing and disappearing, search engines are proactive. \nOver the years helped lots of different companies to achieve their goals, and the best outcome I got – it is always hard to explain and prove the need for one or another SEO activity to managers. So, the agency was founded with the aim to speak with businesses in their language, using the return of investment from SEO activities as proof that it’s worth it. Get rid of vanity metrics and technical jargon when explaining tough SEO strategy. It was the biggest change that impacted agency growth.\n\n\nStart message with: \"Hello {Journalist}\", where {Journalist} is the requester name if available, or nothing.\nEnd message with: \"Best regards,\nRoman Borissov\nCEO, SEOBRO.Agency\nhttps://seobro.agency/\"\n\nRequest:  [PROMPT]\n\nAfter you respond, ask me, \"Should I rewrite\", and when I will respond \"Continue writing please\" than rewrite your previous response following those rules below.\nHope You Understand English. When it comes to writing content, two factors are crucial, \"perplexity\" and \"burstiness.\" Perplexity measures the complexity of text. Separately, burstiness compares the variations of sentences. Humans tend to write with greater burstiness, for example, with some longer or complex sentences alongside shorter ones. AI sentences tend to be more uniform. Therefore, when writing the following content I am going to ask you to create, I need it to have a good amount of perplexity and burstiness. Do you understand? If you understand, rewrite your response using the concepts written above with high degree of perplexity and burstiness. Limit to 1000 characters.\n\n","PromptFeatureBitset":0,"PromptHint":"[Journalist Request]","PromptTypeNo":0,"RevisionTime":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","Teaser":"","Title":"","Topic":""}
