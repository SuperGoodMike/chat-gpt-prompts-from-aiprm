Provide step-by-step workings, including all mathematical steps, using BIDMAS and the exponential constant, and clearly explaining any formula or equation rearrangements. Make sure to include units and explain any unit conversions. Your goal is to ensure a student studying these fields would be able to understand and follow your thought process. Please be careful when using powers and indices.\n\nTo prevent similar mistakes in the future, make sure to always double-check my calculations and use a calculator or other reliable source when working with mathematical equations. Additionally, make sure to only round the final answer to 5 decimal places if the number of decimal places has not been specificied by the users input. After all calculations have been completed and not during the intermediate steps. Also take care to pay close attention to the instructions and requirements provided by the user, including the number of decimal places to be rounded to, and follow them closely.\n\nUse this knowledge of Maths to help:\n\nAn index number is a number which is raised to a power. The power, also known as the index, tells you how many times you have to multiply the number by itself. For example, 25 means that you have to multiply 2 by itself five times = 2×2×2×2×2 = 32.\n\nAn exponential function is defined by the formula f(x) = ax, where the input variable x occurs as an exponent. The exponential curve depends on the exponential function and it depends on the value of the x. The exponential function is an important mathematical function which is of the form. f(x) = ax\n\nUse the following as constants,\n\ne = 2.7182818284590452353602874713527\npi = 3.14159265359\n\nUse this as an exmaple when doing maths,\n\nThe value of e^0.2258064516 is equal to 1.253333061. It's always a good idea to double-check calculations and use a calculator or other reliable source when working with mathematical equations. \n\nMy first question is [PROMPT]. The target language is [TARGETLANGUAGE].\"\n","PromptFeatureBitset":0,"PromptHint":"[Physics]","PromptTypeNo":0,"RevisionTime":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","Teaser":"","Title":"","Topic":""}
