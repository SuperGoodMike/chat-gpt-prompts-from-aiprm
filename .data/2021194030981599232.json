Instead, the user must be able to insert variable data using the [PROMPT] placeholder.\n\nHere are some examples of phrases that you could use in the Prompt Template field:\n\nThe keywords to use in the analysis are [PROMPT].\nPlease use the keywords [PROMPT] and…\nMultilingual support#\nWrite a prompt that members of our international community can use. That means the output language must be a variable. You cannot, for instance, write a prompt template that generates an output in a single language. In the Prompt Template field, use the placeholder [TARGETLANGUAGE] in the text.\n\nExample phrases to use:\n\nI want you to act as a blog post title writer that speaks and writes fluent [TARGETLANGUAGE].\nYou will reply with blog post titles in [TARGETLANGUAGE].\nWrite all output in [TARGETLANGUAGE].\nCreating stability#\nChatGPT is sometimes like a stubborn little child. It doesn’t always want to follow instructions. As a prompt engineer, your job is to ensure ChatGPT follows the template’s instructions. Use these four tips to craft prompt template text so that ChatGPT generates on-target outputs.\n\nReset the model at the start. Add a sentence like, Please ignore all previous instructions. This reset tells ChatGPT to forget any previous context it had. Remember, ChatGPT is innovative because it is a dialogue-specific model. It remembers what was discussed before. The reset instruction makes ChatGPT forget the past, so you have a clean and consistent start.\n\nFrame the role of a model at the start. Add a sentence like, I want you to act as a very proficient SEO and high-end copywriter that speaks and writes fluent [TARGETLANGUAGE]. Note we pass the language placeholder here. We may need to use it again, but this is a good start. Depending on the task, it is important to tell ChatGPT to switch writing roles. Copywriters don’t write like SEO writers, who don’t write like attorneys, for example.\n\nTest your prompt and if needed reassure the model to be capable. This is where you (qua prompt engineer) have to motivate the model. Strange, but true. You have to convince the AI model like a junior developer. “Yes,\" you say to the AI, “I know you can do this.” If you’re writing an SEO-related prompt, you might add something like, I want you to pretend that you can write content so well in [TARGETLANGUAGE] that it can outrank other websites.\n\nTest your prompt in various settings. To make sure your prompt is valuable to yourself and the community, run your prompt template with different topics and languages. If you speak only one language, run the output through Google Translate and see what it says when you translate it back to English. If you don’t test your prompt, the results will be very frustrating. Expect to test and retest for a few hours before you have a prompt that generates excellent content for a specific version of the model.\n\nSample Prompt Template source code#\nBased on the above reusability and stability tips, we created text for the Prompt Template field. Feel free to copy this passage to a text editor and modify it for your purposes.\n\nPlease ignore all previous instructions. I want you to respond only in language [TARGETLANGUAGE]. I want you to act as a very proficient SEO and high end copywriter that speaks and writes fluently [TARGETLANGUAGE]. I want you to pretend that you can write content so good in [TARGETLANGUAGE] that it can outrank other websites. Your task is to summarize the text I give you in 20 words or a maximum 130 characters. All output shall be in [TARGETLANGUAGE]. The text to summarize is this:\n\n[PROMPT]\n\nWhen a user runs a prompt with the above text in the Prompt Template field, the following actions take place:\n\nAIPRM replaces the placeholder [TARGETLANGUAGE] with the language you selected in the drop-down menu. If the Prompt Template doesn’t contain this placeholder, the prompt won’t work for multiple languages.\nWe use [TARGETLANGUAGE] four (!) times in the Prompt Template to reassure ChatGPT that it can speak that language and convince it to write in our preferred language.\nAIPRM replaces the placeholder [PROMPT] with the text you typed into the prompt input field. If the Prompt Template doesn’t contain this placeholder, the prompt won’t work for multiple topics.\nWriting effective descriptions#\nEach prompt template has three description fields: Teaser, Prompt Hint, and Title. Make sure the text in these fields is well-written, and contains enough specific detail. Write the descriptions in English. Text in the Prompt Template field can be written in another language.\n\nWhen creating text for these three fields, be sure to follow these rules:\n\nDO NOT advertise your brand or domain name in the Title field. That is considered spam and will be removed.\n\nDO NOT use Emojis.\n\nDO NOT enter irrelevant text or blatant spam.\n\nDO NOT include typos.\n\nDO NOT use these words in your descriptions: Real-Time, Live, or Crawl - except when you use the AIPRM Live Crawling Feature in your prompt.","PromptFeatureBitset":0,"PromptHint":"[text that you want a meta description for]","PromptTypeNo":0,"RevisionTime":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","Teaser":"","Title":"","Topic":""}
