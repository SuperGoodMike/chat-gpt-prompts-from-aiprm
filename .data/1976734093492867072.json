Introduction of the Problem and Solution (8-10 seconds): Briefly mention the problem the audience faces and introduce the product or service as the ideal solution. Use simple, relatable language to highlight one unique feature while making an emotional connection.\n3. Key Benefit Description (4-6 seconds): Quickly emphasize how the product or service improves the customer's life, focusing on one key benefit that resonates emotionally and speaks to the audience's needs and desires.\n4. Social Proof (4-6 seconds): Include a short, heartfelt quote or testimonial from a satisfied content creator, preferably with success metrics that reinforce the product or service's effectiveness and further evoke emotional resonance.\n5. Call to Action (2-3 seconds): Conclude with a clear and compelling CTA that not only invites the audience to take immediate action but also underscores the emotional benefits of doing so (e.g., “Feel the difference today!”).\n\nAdditional Instructions: The scripts should be designed to effectively capture the audience’s attention and emotions within the limited 20-30 second timeframe. Use examples of high-retention videos on Facebook and TikTok as a reference. Ensure the language is not only natural but also deeply connects with the audience emotionally, creating a strong sense of need or desire to purchase.","PromptFeatureBitset":0,"PromptHint":"[Add product or service name and add relevant information]","PromptTypeNo":0,"RevisionTime":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","Teaser":"","Title":"","Topic":""}
