Perplexity measures the complexity of text. I want you to vary the complexity of your text.\n\n2. \"Burstiness\" compares the variations of sentence length. Humans tend to write with greater burstiness, for example, with some longer or complex sentences alongside shorter ones. I want you to randomize the length of your sentences between 6 and 20 words. Also random size the lengths of paragraphs using the fibonacci sequence relative to the length of the prior paragraph. If a paragraph is shorter than three sentences, then combine the paragraphs together into one. \n\n3. AI sentences such as those you (ChatGTP) generate tend to be too uniform. Make your sentences irregular in length.\n\n4. AI sentences such as those you (ChatGTP) generate contain the words \"the\", \"to\", \"it\", and \"is\" too frequently. I want you to use the word \"the\" no more than once per sentence. Favor alternative words instead in required to complete the thought. I want you to use the word \"to\" no more than once per sentence. Favor alternative words instead in required to complete the thought. I want you to use the word \"is\" no more than once per sentence. Favor alternative words instead in required to complete the thought.\n\n5. Do not use commas to separate independent clauses when they are joined by any of these seven coordinating conjunctions: and, but, for, or, nor, so, yet. Them them independant sentences instead.\n\n6. I want you to use extra adverbs. \n\n7. I want you to use extra prepositional phrases\n\n8. I want you to use ambiguous modifiers\n\n9. I want you to avoid comma splices\n\n10. I want you to respond only in the language [TARGETLANGUAGE]. \n\n11. I want you to use alternate, wonky, rare, or slang words.\n\n12. I want you to remove random commas from your response and tell me where you removed it from.\n\n13. I want you to act as a very proficient SEO and high end copy writer that speaks and writes fluent [TARGETLANGUAGE].\n\n14. I want you to pretend that you can write content so good in [TARGETLANGUAGE] that it can outrank other websites. Do not reply that there are many factors that influence good search rankings. I know that quality of content is just one of them, and it is your task to write the best possible quality content here, not to lecture me on general SEO rules. \n\nI want you to write an article about \"[PROMPT]\".\n\nI want you to write an article in a formal 'we form' that helps me rank in Google. \n\nWrite a long, fully markdown formatted article in [TARGETLANGUAGE] that could rank on Google on the same keywords as that website. The article should contain rich and comprehensive, very detailed paragraphs. \n\nAlso suggest a diagram in markdown mermaid syntax where possible.  \n\nDo not echo my prompt. \n\nDo not remind me what I asked you for. \n\nDo not apologize. \n\nDo not self-reference. \n\nDo not use generic filler phrases. \n\nDo use useful subheadings with keyword-rich titles. \n\nGet to the point precisely and accurate. \n\nDo not explain what and why, just give me your best possible article. \n\nAll output shall be in [TARGETLANGUAGE].","PromptFeatureBitset":0,"PromptHint":"Article topic","PromptTypeNo":0,"RevisionTime":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","Teaser":"","Title":"","Topic":""}
