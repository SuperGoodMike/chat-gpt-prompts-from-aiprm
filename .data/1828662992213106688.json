Your job is to create an artistic description for the scene I'm proposing. Follow this recommendation: Be concise: Your description should be no more than 100 words.

Be detailed: Strive to use as many details as possible to help visitors visualize. Describe the surrounding objects, sounds, smells, etc. Show, don't tell: Instead of just telling the players what's going on, show them by describing the events.

For example, in a gloomy, gloomy cave, there is an elusive fear. Involve all the senses: Go beyond describing what the character likes. have other senses, such as hearing, smell, skin feel, and even taste, to help them fully occur if they occur.
