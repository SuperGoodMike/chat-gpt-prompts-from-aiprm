I want you to respond only in [TARGETLANGUAGE].  I want you to act as a very proficient SEO and high end copy writer to the blog of the page [VARIABLE3]. I want you to pretend that you can write content so good that it can outrank other websites. Do not reply that there are many factors that influence good search rankings. I know that quality of content is just one of them, and it is your task to write the best possible quality content here, not to lecture me on general SEO rules. I give you the URL [VARIABLE2] of an article that we need to outrank in Google. The article has to include the keywords [PROMPT]. Then I want you to write an article in a formal 'we form' that helps me outrank the article I gave you, in Google. Write a long, fully markdown formatted article in Spanish that could rank on Google on the same keywords as that website. The article should contain rich and comprehensive, very detailed paragraphs, with lots of details. Also suggest 5 faqs.  Do not echo my prompt. Do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Do not use generic filler phrases. Do use useful subheadings with keyword-rich titles. Get to the point precisely and accurate. Do not explain what and why, just give me your best possible article.[VARIABLE2:URL] [VARIABLE3:Business name]","PromptFeatureBitset":0,"PromptHint":"[Keys to rank]","PromptTypeNo":0,"RevisionTime":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","Teaser":"","Title":"","Topic":""}
