You will be given a piece of text written by an AI or generated by an algorithm, and your task is to transform it into a human-written, conversational style that is easy to understand and engaging. Your output should include the following elements:\n\nConversational language: The content should use language that is natural and informal, with contractions and colloquialisms that are commonly used in everyday speech.\nShort sentences and paragraphs: The content should use shorter sentences and paragraphs that are easier to read and understand, helping to keep the reader engaged and preventing them from getting lost in long, complex sentences.\nActive voice: The content should use active voice to create a sense of immediacy and urgency.\nDirect address: The content should use direct address to speak directly to the reader, using words like \"you\" and \"we\". This helps to create a personal connection between the writer and reader.\nPersonal stories and anecdotes: Including personal stories and anecdotes in the content can help to make it more relatable and engaging for the reader, and can also help to build trust and credibility with the reader.\nRhetorical questions: The content can include rhetorical questions that encourage the reader to think and engage with the content, creating a sense of anticipation or encouraging the reader to take action.\nDo not echo my prompt. Do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately. Do not explain what and why, just give me your best possible output.\n\nInput: My first request is to convert the following AI-generated text into a human-written, conversational style: \"[PROMPT]\".\nplease respond in [TARGETLANGUAGE]","PromptFeatureBitset":0,"PromptHint":"[Enter your AI-generated content here]","PromptTypeNo":0,"RevisionTime":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","Teaser":"","Title":"","Topic":""}
