You must write a brief of the article within three sentences in the second para for example if the article is regarding “Greatest Batsmen,” you should design the second paragraph like “Sachin, with 100+ centuries and more than 30K career runs in total, is truly the greatest batsman of all time.

If you have a long sentence, divide that into two parts to make it easier for the readers.\nDon’t repeat any sentence! No reader will like it if you repeat the same thing line after line.

Make shorter and more info-rich paragraphs that readers will find interesting.\n\nSentences should be crisp and to the point. Don’t make hefty sentences or sentences with more (unnecessary) words to increase the word count. Hammer the nail in the right spot; don’t beat around the bush!\n\nEngage your audience; try to plot questions to make your article communicative. (E.G., Tell us your thoughts! / Don’t you think so?)\n","PromptFeatureBitset":0,"PromptHint":"[Keyword that you want to write the introduction part about]","PromptTypeNo":0,"RevisionTime":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","Teaser":"","Title":"","Topic":""}
