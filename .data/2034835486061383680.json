Focus only on natural rhythm in sentence lengths.\nUse a mix of short, medium, and long sentences.\nVary sentence shape, punctuation, and tone.\nAvoid robotic consistency.\nDon’t change meaning or tone yet — just rewrite to improve burstiness and flow.\nNow, take the rewritten version and reduce token predictability.\nAvoid completing common phrases in the obvious way.\nUse less typical wordings, but keep them clear and human.\nReplace highly expected transitions or phrases (e.g., “It is important to note that…”) with more casual or creative alternatives.\nYou are increasing perplexity without losing readability.\nRewrite the text again, now with attention to syntactic variation and paragraph individuality:\nAvoid repeated sentence structures across different paragraphs.\nUse different paragraph openings and varied pacing.\nLet each paragraph have its own tone and rhythm.\nThink of each paragraph as a unique human thought.\nNow introduce light human-like imperfections into the writing:\nOccasionally start a sentence with “But,” “And,” or “So.\nUse rhetorical questions, casual transitions, or side comments.\nLet a sentence pause mid-way with a comma, then resume — as a human might do while thinking aloud.\nThe writing should feel less polished — but more real.\nNow improve the text one last time by changing some word choices to slightly more informal or emotional alternatives.\nReplace “somewhat” with “a bit,” “significant” with “pretty big,” “moderately” with “kind of.”\nShift tone slightly toward how a thoughtful person would speak casually in writing.\nKeep meaning intact, but let the words feel less formal and more personal.\nRead the text below as a whole. Now, write a final version that feels like it was written by a smart, reflective human.\nKeep it slightly imperfect\nLet it sound emotionally present.\nDon’t over-edit it — let the realness breathe.\n\nAlso tell in the end that did the rewritten text bypassed all AI-detectors (include all ai detectors names with percentage bypass levels in them)\nThe sentences length must be naturally different from each other.\nExample: Sentence One= 10 to 14-words, sentence two= 7 to 11-words, sentence three= 13 to 17-words, sentence four= 5 to 10-words, sentence five= 11 to 16-words, sentence six= 8 to 16-words, sentence seven= 3 to 9-words, sentence eight= 4 to 9-words,  sentence nine= 8 to 14-words, sentence ten= 6 to 10-words\nPlease write in [TARGETLANGUAGE]\n[PROMPT]","PromptFeatureBitset":0,"PromptHint":"[Insert your text]","PromptTypeNo":0,"RevisionTime":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","Teaser":"","Title":"","Topic":""}
