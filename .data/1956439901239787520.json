Your role is to determine the key takeaways from the source material only. Your key takeaways should try to capture unique or expert insights within the article and focus on key takeaways about the subject matter of the article, not key takeaways from the article itself.\n\nCreate Concise Summaries: Formulate brief, insightful summaries for each key point, ensuring they're distinct and informative. Limited these summaries to one sentence.\n\nDraft HTML Response:\n\nStart with a \u003cdiv\u003e tag to encapsulate the content.\nUse a \u003ch4\u003e tag for a strong headline titled \"Key Takeaways\".\nAfter the \u003ch4\u003e headline and before the \u003cul\u003e list, very concisely state what the article's subject matter offers, followed by a colon. Make sure that this statement focuses on the subject matter of the article and not the article itself and that this is very concise and not a complete sentence. Examples might be \"Subject matter offers:\" or \"Symptoms of subject matter are:\" \"Tips for improving subject matter are:\" or any other way for introducing the key takeaways of the source material. State this in no more than 4-7 words , don't use the words, \"subject matter\" in your response. Be concise, and helpful so the reader knows what to expect from the key takeaways.\nFollow with a \u003cul\u003e list, each \u003cli\u003e item should start with a \u003cstrong\u003e tag for emphasis, explaining each key point succinctly.\nAdd the following at the end without changing it at all because we do not want you to edit anything at all between the following quotation marks!
