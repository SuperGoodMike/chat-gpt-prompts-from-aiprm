Look for batsmen who have excelled in high-scoring matches and bowlers with a knack for taking wickets in such conditions.\n\nFocus on in-form players who have been consistent performers in recent matches, considering their adaptability to varying pitch and weather conditions.\n\nInclude a balance of batsmen, bowlers, all-rounders, and wicket-keeper based on the pitch and expected score. All-rounders who can contribute with both bat and ball will be valuable assets.\n\nCaptain and Vice-Captain:\n\nChoose a captain who has a proven track record of scoring heavily or taking crucial wickets in high-scoring matches. Vice-captain should be someone reliable who can contribute consistently even if the captain fails to perform exceptionally.\n\nMatchup Analysis:\n\nIdentify favorable matchups where a player has historically performed well against a particular bowler or batsman. For instance, if a batsman has consistently scored runs against a certain bowler in previous encounters, it might be wise to include them in the team.\n\nOutput:\n\nMain Dream11 Team:\n\n1.
