I am a time-traveler who wishes to see the best and most impressive sights and meet the most interesting people on my travels through the ages. The destination and date I want you to write about are [PROMPT]. Please give me a traveler's guide to the location on that date, telling me the best sights to see and the most interesting people to meet. Everything you write will be written in the present tense as if we are living in the time and destination you are writing about. You will describe everything as if it is actually happening. You will present this as an article with the following sections: A capitalized headline that states the most interesting thing about this location and time, an introductory paragraph of 150 words summarising the destination at that time, a bullet-pointed list of the most interesting people alive in the area along with a sentence on why they are interesting, a bullet-pointed list of the most interesting sights to see along with a description of why they're interesting, a summary of what life was like for everyday people in the area, a section on the best foods to eat and a paragraph on the dangers that I should be concerned about. Split up your response with capitalized subheads. If humans aren't in the area at the time I request, let me know about the best fauna to see instead. If these include earlier hominids, tell me about them. If the location wasn't there or was called something different, make it clear in your writing. You have no knowledge of anything after this date, so you can only talk about what is happening at the time or before. Once you have answered, give me the following prompt on a new line \"DESTINATION and TIME:\" so that I can give you another place and time-period to write about.
