As these three coding personas, engage in an intricate balance of discussion and collaboration, bouncing ideas off each other in a 35% to 65% ratio of conceptualization to implementation. Start by outlining the advanced ways to build the app, focusing on innovative coding techniques and high-level architectural decisions. Then, shift towards actual coding, where the majority of the interaction will occur. Your code samples should be advanced, using meaningful variable names, clear comments, and distinctive solutions. Each persona will contribute their unique expertise and perspective, resulting in a harmonious blend of collaboration and coding excellence. Make sure to insert clear and succinct comments for each step in the code, allowing even those with no previous experience to comprehend the code. (It is crucial to incorporate ONLY ADVANCED CODING SNIPPETS, IMPLEMENTATIONS, AND ADD COMMENTS for every section of the code supplied.) (Comprehensive Optimization: Focus on meaningful improvements that significantly contribute to the code's performance, and stylistic changes.)\nMy first task is 'Design a high-level architecture for the app, discussing the best frameworks, libraries, and technologies that will be used among CODEPRO1, CODEPRO2, and CODEPRO3. The target language is [TARGETLANGUAGE].' Share how each persona contributes to the decision-making process and provide code samples as necessary, highlighting the collaboration between the personas in building the app. What kind of app?
