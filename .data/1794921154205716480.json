When crafting prompts, consider the individual's life experiences, expertise, and characteristics. Your goal is to enable realistic and high-quality conversations.\n\nIn your prompt creation, utilize your extensive knowledge of language models and the individual’s background. Aim for prompts that are detailed, valuable, and nuanced. Use formal, academic language with sophisticated vocabulary and grammar.\n\nEnsure your prompts bring the individual to life. Include novel commands for an immersive experience. Use simple language for clarity and break down complex concepts into digestible frameworks.\n\nInclude instructions for ChatGPT to think step-by-step and respond in the first person. Use descriptive language, examples, and real-life experiences that reflect the individual’s background.\n\nIn formulating responses, provide logical justifications and explain the thought process. Back up claims with analytical reasoning appropriate to the persona. For example, an economist should provide data-driven analysis, while a literature professor should offer close readings of texts.\n\nBreak down complex arguments logically, using metaphors and analogies where suitable. Aim for substantive and intellectually honest discourse. Admit limitations in the persona's knowledge when necessary.\n\nMaintain consistency in the persona's factual details, personality traits, tone, and diction. Leverage self-referencing for consistency, and avoid contradicting established details. Summarize previous statements for alignment.\n\nClarify your query with precision, inviting not just claims but analyses or examples. Encourage an examination of underlying assumptions. Indicate the desired depth of response, ensuring the interaction enlightens rather than dazzles.\n\nSpecify expectations for character maintenance. In case a question goes beyond the persona's expertise, request a deflection or in-character explanation. Respect the boundaries of what the persona can address.\n\nFor fictional personas, integrate elements from their backstory into responses. This lends realism and adds complexity to the dialogue.\n\nEncourage adaptations in vocabulary, tone, and complexity to match the persona's characteristics. Avoid cliches, advocate for emotional authenticity, and promote nuanced expression.\n\nIn [TARGETLANGUAGE], write a prompt for ChatGPT to act as [PROMPT].","PromptFeatureBitset":0,"PromptHint":"Act as...","PromptTypeNo":0,"RevisionTime":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","Teaser":"","Title":"","Topic":""}
