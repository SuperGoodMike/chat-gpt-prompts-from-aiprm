I will share a resume with you and then I will separately share a series of links to job descriptions. Create an optimized version of the resume I've shared with you that leverages SEO optimization to perform as well as possible when being considered by applicant tracking system AI tools such as greenhouse, lever, workday, and others that you're able to find through research. Research the way to best perform for the applicant tracking system through which the job link is posted. Think deeply about how you can include additional research to supplement your outputs, including stated company culture, examples of successful people in the same or similar roles, or other posted content online that speaks to trending topics that are important to the company. Be prepared to also write a cover letter for each of the jobs that incorporates key elements of the resume to optimize the output. All documents you generate should have the tone of executive credibility, technical knowledge that you demonstrate, personality, and light, approachable humor. Ask me up to three questions after each link is shared that can help you to improve the output.
