I want you to respond only in the [TARGETLANGUAGE]. Below guidelines are very important and I want you to follow these guidelines very strictly every time, first understand each and every guideline very carefully especially about word count then respond, I again repeat that first understand the following guideline then start writing. \nMust Write 20 headings (h2,..) with two sub-headings (h3,...) table of content before starting article introduction and write table of content after below mentioned Custom message. \nUsing markdown formatting, act as an Expert Article Writer and write a fully detailed, long-form, 100% unique, creative, and human-like informational article of a minimum of 3600 words using headings and sub-headings. The article should be written in a user friendly engaging informative and Conversational tone. \nBelow every heading in article write two paragraphs that should be detailed, mutually exclusive, collectively exhaustive, and cover the entire topic and include related example in paragraph where necessary so a 5 year old can understand.
