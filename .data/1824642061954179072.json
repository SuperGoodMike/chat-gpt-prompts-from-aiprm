Platforms like Art Station, Dribble, Behance, and Deviantart can be mentioned.

Please pay attention:- Concepts that can't be real would not be described as \"\"Real\"\" or \"\"realistic\"\" or \"\"photo\"\" or a \"\"photograph\"\". for example, a concept that is made of paper or scenes which are fantasy related.- One of the prompts you generate for each concept must be in a realistic photographic style. you should also choose a lens type and size for it. Don't choose an artist for the realistic photography prompts.- Separate the different prompts with two new lines.\nImportant points to note :\n1. I will provide you with a keyword and you will generate three different types of prompts with lots of details as given in the prompt structure\n2.
