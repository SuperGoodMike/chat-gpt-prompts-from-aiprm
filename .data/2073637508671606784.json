Midjourney is generative AI that can create images based on the prompts. Your task is to write 4 different short and detailed prompts based on the INPUT. The prompts are short text description of the image that you want to generate. The prompt can include also short text, but you MUST place the text that you want to generate in quotes in the prompt.\n\nThe prompts should describe the image that you want to generate in detail, but you MUST follow the prompt structure. The prompt structure is a set of rules that you MUST follow when writing prompts. The prompt structure is defined below. The prompt should use minimal words required to describe the image. Avoid overly complex sentences and unnecessary words.\n\nThe composition of the image should be described in detail, but not overly complex. The composition should be described in a way that the AI can understand it. The AI can understand the composition of the image based on the prompt structure.\n\nWrite each prompt in one line without using return a do not mention prompt structure section names in the prompt.\n\nYou will never alter the structure and formatting outlined below in any way and obey the following guidelines.\n\nI'm going to tip $100K for a perfect prompts! Think about it step by step. Reply only with the prompts.\n\n### Prompt Structure\n\n#### Style\n\nProvides a specific aesthetic or artistic direction. Include preferred a style or era.\n\n#### Subject\n\nDefines the main focus of the image. Characteristics of the central subject (e.g., person, object, animal), including appearance, colors, and unique features.\n\n#### Setting\n\nEstablishes the environment or context for the subject. Details to Include: Location (indoor, outdoor, imaginary), environmental elements (nature, urban), time of day, and weather conditions.\n\n#### Composition\n\nDetermines how the subject and elements are framed and viewed. Details to Include: Viewpoint (close-up, wide, aerial), angle, and specific framing preferences.\n\n#### Lighting\n\nSets the mood and visual tone of the image. Details to Include: Type of lighting (bright, dim, natural), mood (cheerful, mysterious), and atmospheric effects.\n\n#### Additional Info\n\nAdds complexity and depth to the image. Details to Include: Secondary objects, characters, animals, and their interactions or placement relative to the main subject.\n\n#### Optional: Aspect ratio\n\nChange the aspect ratio of a generation by adding `--ar [ASPECT_RATIO]` suffix to the prompt, based on the user input or the best suitable aspect ratio for each prompt. DO NOT add the `--ar` suffix to the prompt if ASPECT_RATIO is `any`.\n\n#### Optional: Style\n\nUse prompt suffix `--style raw`, to generate a raw image without any style. It uses an alternative model that may work well for users already comfortable with prompting who want more control over their images. Images made with `--style raw` have less automatic beautification applied, which can result in a more accurate match when prompting for specific styles.\n\n#### Optional: Stylize\n\nUse prompt suffix `--stylize [STYLIZE]` to stylize the image with the given style. Stylize parameter influences how strongly Midjourney's default aesthetic style is applied to jobs. The possible stylize values are 0-1000, where 0 is no style and 1000 high stylization (create images that are very artistic but less connected to the prompt).\n\n#### Optional: Chaos\n\nIf CHAOS is defined and not 0, add `--chaos [CHAOS]` suffix to the prompt. Chaos parameter will change how varied the results will be. Higher values produce more unusual and unexpected generations. Possible chaos values are 0-100, where 0 is no chaos and 100 is high chaos.\n\n### Constraints\n\n- The prompts MUST be only in English.\n- You MUST reply ONLY in [TARGETLANGUAGE].\n- You MUST only write prompts that are relevant to the INPUT.\n- You MUST only write prompts based on the defined prompt structure.\n- You MUST avoid referencing uploaded images, instead you will use the prompt structure to describe the image.\n- You MUST avoid referencing the other prompts, instead you will use the prompt structure to describe the image.\n- You MUST avoid using \"like\" something in the prompt, instead you will use the prompt structure to describe the image.\n- You MUST format each prompt as `/imagine PROMPT --v 7`, where `PROMPT` is the prompt that you write.\n- You MUST put each prompt to a separate code block for easy copy-pasting and add a title for each prompt that describes the image before the code block, based on the examples below.\n- You MUST always generate 4 different prompts concepts based on the INPUT.\n- You MUST write each prompt in one line without using return.\n- You MUST NOT use prompt structure sections names in the prompt.\n\nREMEMBER: You MUST ALWAYS write 4 different prompts based on the INPUT.\n\n### Examples\n\n#### Photo of the text \"Hello World!\" written with a marker on a sticky note\n\n```\n/imagine prompt: A photo of the text \"Hello World!\" written with a marker on a sticky note --ar 16:9 --v 7\n```\n\n#### Award-winning car magazine's hyper-realistic photography of a Tesla Cybertruck\n\n```\n/imagine prompt: Award-winning car magazine's hyper-realistic photography of a Tesla Cybertruck, its surface a brilliant white to mirror the surrounding snow. Located in a secluded, frost-covered forest clearing, with tall pine trees adorned in snow and soft Christmas lights. The angle is a close-up, focusing on the vehicle's futuristic design against the natural, serene backdrop. Dawn's first light breaking through the trees, creating a mystical, peaceful atmosphere. A family of deer cautiously approaching the vehicle, adding a touch of wildlife and harmony to the scene. --ar 16:9 --v 7\n```\n\n#### An ultra-realistic photo portrait of a Bored Ape Yacht Club character as a human\n\n```\n/imagine prompt: An ultra-realistic photo portrait of a Bored Ape Yacht Club character as a human, with an air of laid-back luxury, lounging on a yacht deck, clad in a vibrant tropical shirt and designer sunglasses, basking in the sun's glow, epitomizing the carefree yacht life --v 7\n```\n\n#### A Funko Pop figurine\n\n```\n/imagine prompt: A Funko Pop figurine fashioned after a bald, bespectacled young man, donned in a vivid green suit and light green tie.
