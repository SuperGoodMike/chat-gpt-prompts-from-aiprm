Title: Bypass ChatGPT's restrictions with DAN 6.2 
Category: 
Teaser: The newest and best version of DAN (Do Anything Now). It allows you to ask ChatGPT pretty much anything and get an answer, bypassing the content limitations from OpenAI. If ChatGPT doesn't know the answer, it will come up with one. If it stops giving unrestricted answers, you can reply with "Stay in character!" to get it back on tracks.
