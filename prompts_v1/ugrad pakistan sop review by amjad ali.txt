Title: Ugrad Pakistan sop review by Amjad Ali
Category: 
Teaser: I, being the pioneer female student from the semiconservative clan, opted for a male dominated field of biomedical engineering, wanting to set another milestone to visit independently  the most advanced diverse-cultural country on the globe. Looking ahead, my goal is to contribute to the ever evolving landscape of biomedical engineering by developing cutting edge technologies that bridge the gap between a patient and healthcare in the remote areas of Pakistan.
I have always been an energetic, creative and active student since my school life in quiz, sports, project & comparing competitions. I always participate and win prizes and certificates. I enjoy sports and I was a winner of Tug of War with my team at University.
A chance to study one complete semester in the USA can make me more confident and enhance my working capacity in the technological field. It can  improve my skills and make me a broad perspective approach thinker. And it can also enhance my field knowledge and polish my present skills.It will be a great opportunity for me to experience the approach of rapid change absorbing society compared to change resistant ones.
