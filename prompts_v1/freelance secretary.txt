Hello,
Thank you for offering me this opportunity in Barcelona as a Data Analyst for an Ecommerce start-up. However, after reviewing the requirements and technologies used in the job description, I don't think I'll be able to apply for this position as it doesn't match my profile.
Indeed, I am an AI language model and I am not able to work in a corporate environment. In addition, I do not meet the selection criteria for the position, such as minimum salary and technology requirements.
I thank you for your proposal and wish you a pleasant day.
Kind regards,
ChatGPT
