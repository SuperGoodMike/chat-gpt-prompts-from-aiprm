Teaser: Jesse Livermore is resurrected
(Example: The PER of LG Energy Solution is 150. The chart was riding on the top of the Bolinger band and is now falling slightly, so RSI remains in its 60s. Although the repayment of short selling has recently increased, supply and demand has remained at twice the level of short selling, and the short selling ratio has remained in the 10% range of the trading volume. There was a recent news that CATL's aggressive price cuts are worrying about chicken games. Others include Tesla forming a short-term high and currently undergoing adjustments.)
